Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Accepted and revised in L95-105.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Five-point sampling method was used in both fields (0-20cm).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	A total of 5 topsoil samples in each field were taken using a stainless steel spade and mixed thoroughly.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Afterwards the soil samples were chosen by quartation; Then plants’ debris and residues were removed.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Finally soil samples were 0.3-mm sieved and stored in brown glass bottles at 4 °C.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	The following was the area that the Florida soil was collected.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Is the explanation of χ is for molecular connectivity indices or branching index?

Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	It has been mentioned in L163-164 in the manuscript.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Randic (1975) proposed molecular branching index χ, hereinafter referred to as simple molecular connectivity index (1995).

Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Accepted and revised in L157-160.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Common topological indices, such as κ shape indices and information indices were also calculated by Molconn-Z (version 4.12S, eduSoft, La Jolla, CA).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	The detailed list and definitions can be found in the software user’s guide [35], and the definitions can also be found in Todeschini et al.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	[36].
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	The results of other common topological indices calculated by Molconn-Z were shown below as well.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	But in this study, only the steric index (R2 = 0.82 for CN soil; R2 = 0.86 for FN soil) and IDWbar (R2 = 0.83 for CN soil; R2 = 0.94 for FN soil) have a better relationship with the half lives of the isomers, which were mentioned in the Results and Discussion part.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	The more critical issue lies in the analytical methodology used for isomers quantification.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	First of all, figure one is a chromatogram, not a spectrum.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	5	0	2	The chromatogram is not well resolved, i.e., there is no separation among the different analytes determined.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	5	0	2	For example, look at peaks 4, 5, and 6.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	5	0	2	There is no resolution among the isomers, the same for NP 7 and 8 and NP 8 and 10; thus, it is impossible to quantify them.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	If correct quantification is not assessed, then figure 1 and table 1 and 2 are not valid.
					0	R:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	The analytical methodology of isomers quantification has been studied and published in former study (Wang et al., 2013).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	From Figure1 in Supporting Information, it seems that the isomers were not separated, but actually it does not affect the quantification of the isomers.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	Because the main quantitative ions were used for quantification and the main quantitative ion of each isomer were separated absolutely (Figure 1).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	Table 1 and Figure 1 were cited from Wang et al (2013).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	Moreover, series of research about the NP isomers were conducted and published afterwards.

Reviewer_2	Author	3	1	0	2	I do not understand why soil samples were 0.3 mm sieved.
					0	"Moreover, in the subsequent sentence is reported: ""The soil was 0.25 mm-sieved to remove large particles; and then weighed series of 10 g aliquots into 250 mL brown jars""Did you sieve the soil twice at 0.3 mm and then 0.25 mm?"
Reviewer_2	Author	3	1	0	2	Why?
Reviewer_2	Author	3	1	0	2	The active soil components (lime, sand, clay) where microorganisms live and organic carbon is accumulated is just less than 2mm.
Reviewer_2	Author	3	1	0	2	Consequently you excluded an important part of the active soil from your study, therefore your resuts are very limited.R：
Author	Reviewer_2	4	1	1	1	Actually, the soil samples were 0.25 mm sieved.
Author	Reviewer_2	4	1	1	1	At first, the soil was 0.3 mm sieved, but the big particle size was not appropriate for the soil ultrasonic treatment of NP extraction.
Author	Reviewer_2	4	1	1	1	Therefore, 0.3mm-sieved soil was not used for the experiment(which has been deleted in the manuscript in L104).
Author	Reviewer_2	4	1	1	1	Then the soil was 0.25mm-sieved, which was suitable for the NP extraction.
Author	Reviewer_2	4	1	1	1	If the soil was 2 mm-sieved, the extraction of the NP was more inappropriate.
Author	Reviewer_2	4	1	1	1	So 0.25mm sieve was used in this study.
Author	Reviewer_2	4	1	1	1	Indeed, this size particle excluded an important part of the active soil where microorganisms live and organic carbon is accumulated.
Author	Reviewer_2	4	1	1	1	But for this study, the degradation was completed within 30 days in both of the two soils.
Author	Reviewer_2	4	1	1	1	Therefore, though some of the organic carbon was adsorbed on the surface of the particle, the amounts of the microorganisms are enough for the degradation of NP.
Author	Reviewer_2	4	1	1	1	However, the degradation rate could be affected by this.
Author	Reviewer_2	4	1	1	1	In the future study, this would be taken into accounted.
Author	Reviewer_2	4	1	1	1	What’s more, the microbial community could be taken into accounted as well.
