					0	The presented manuscript is related to the study of an exopolysaccharide isolated from the extremophilic microorganism Bacillus haynesii CamB6.
					0	The authors used the RSM based on central composite design technique to maximize the EPS production by B. haynesii, and also conducted a diverse study of the EPS properties.
					0	The studied EPS showed promising properties to use in the food industry.
					0	In combination with a high yield of polysaccharide from the bacterial mass, this makes it attractive for practical use.
					0	Basically, the work was done at a fairly high professional level, the material is presented clearly, well structured, the data obtained are discussed with the previously obtained literature data.
					0	Methods are described adequately.
					0	Major remarks
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	To my deep regret the structural characteristic of EPS is the weak point of this publication.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and NMR spectroscopy data can only be regarded as preliminary.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	According to the 1H NMR spectrum, it can be assumed that EPS has a complex branched structure.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	Probably, to establish its structure, it is necessary to use chemical methods (hydrolysis, methylation, etc.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	), as well as two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	EPC is isolated from a thermal spring of volcanic origin, which contains a set of various elements, including heavy metals.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	It is advisable, in my opinion, to provide information on the content of heavy metals in the EPS, since the authors plan to offer this product for the food industry in the future.
					0	Minor remarks:
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	"Line 42: It is premature to include the term ""structure"" in keywords at this stage."
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	Line 526-527: The proposal should be reformulated.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	According to Figure 7. the activity of the ascorbic acid is higher than the activity of EPS produced by CamB6.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	1	0	2	The English language was improved, but there are still errors.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	2	0	2	The following comments were not addressed correctly:
Reviewer_1	Author	3	3	0	2	Why was linkage analysis not performed?
					0	(I was referring to the chemical method by methylation.)
Reviewer_1	Author	3	3	0	2	Bacterial EPSs are normally composed of repeating units.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	3	0	2	Based on the 1H NMR spectrum, the purity and/or heterogeneity of the EPS is questioned.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	3	0	2	(I was referring to peak intensities that are not uniform.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	4	0	2	The new spectra emphasize this even more: for example, I count at least 10 H1/H2 cross peaks of different intensities on the COSY.)
Reviewer_1	Author	3	4	0	2	The authors added a COSY spectrum but did not analyze it.
					0	They deleted erroneous information about mannose residues, but came up with new conclusions about mannose identity and linkages based solely on chemical shift of anomeric proton/carbon.
					0	TOCSY and HMBC are mentioned in methods, but no results are presented.
					0	The information contained in the other 2D spectra was not exploited to provide structural information.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	5	0	2	Chemical shift similarity is not sufficient to identify monosaccharide and linkage in a polysaccharide repeating unit.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	5	0	2	The evidences for the partial structure given are not convincing.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	5	0	2	If the authors do not add methylation analysis and perform full NMR spectral analysis, the claims about structure determination should be removed from the manuscript.
Reviewer_2	Author	3	1	0	2	The authors took into account the comments of the reviewer and significantly improved the article.
					0	Manuscript biomolecules-1691308 In this manuscript, the exopolysaccharide from Bacillus haynesii CamB6 was exhaustively characterized.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	Unfortunately, its structure was not fully determined.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	The manuscript is very long: it contains a lot of information and many references not always pertinent to EPS characterization.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Optimization of production constitutes an important part not mentioned in the title.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	Acceptability for food applications was not discussed.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	5	0	2	Verb tenses should be checked.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	5	0	2	Articles (mostly definite, but also indefinite) are often missing and sometimes superfluous.
					0	General comments:
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	EPS vs. EPSs in plural form should be consistent throughout.

Author	Reviewer_1	4	9	5	1	We agree with some of the comments that you made.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	9	5	1	However, we would like to remind you that the main purpose of this manuscript is not the complete elucidation of the EPS chemical structure but also the optimization of the EPS production, and characterization of the EPS functional properties.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	9	5	1	At the same time, we provided different chemical properties like: sugar identification and its molar ratio, molecular weight, functional group analysis and thermal stability of the EPS, and this journal has recently published other papers with similar or less chemical information on the EPS, for instance: Kuo, H.-C.; Liu, Y.-W.; Lum, C.-C.; Hsu, K.-D.; Lin, S.-P.; Hsieh, C.-W.; Lin, H.-W.; Lu, T.-Y.; Cheng, K.- C. Ganoderma formosanum Exopolysaccharides Inhibit Tumor Growth via Immunomodulation.

Author	Reviewer_1	4	13	5	1	On the other side, we performed the 1D and 2D - NMR analysis as complementary information to the other techniques in the present work.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	13	5	1	Such analysis was performed to try to replace the traditional acid hydrolysis, methylation/acetylation and GC-MS used in glycoside analysis.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	13	5	1	On the opposite to NMR, we do not have access to this analysis, and we could not find it as a service.

Author	Reviewer_1	4	17	5	1	The HPLC and NMR results from the present work confirmed the heterogeneity of the EPS (3 different sugar moieties with different molar ratios), which agrees with the other reported mannan polysaccharides.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	17	5	1	The 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts are comparable with literature reports of other similar EPS or oligosaccharides, where complex structures are identified by NMR too (Casillo et al., 2021; Chatterjee et al; 2018).
Author	Reviewer_1	4	17	5	1	Besides, our 2D-NMR analysis supported EPS heterogeneity, identifying different types of monomer linkages.

Author	Reviewer_1	4	21	5	1	Your mention of the non-uniform peak intensity confirming the three different sugar units found.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	21	5	1	This is because the signal intensity of NMR peaks is related to an -H abundance.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	21	5	1	Different monomer ratios are responsible for this variation and support our findings.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	21	5	1	Also, the 10 H1/H2 cross peaks observed in the COSY spectra supported our findings of EPS heterogeneity, given the following facts: 1) We found 3 different types of sugars by HPLC.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	21	5	1	2) We identified by NMR at least 2 types of linkages α 1-2 Man-Man and alfa 1-4 Man-Man monosaccharides.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	21	5	1	3) There are other 2 sugars for which the β- type of linkage was identified but not the exact sugar position.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	21	5	1	4) Anomeric protons shifts from units at the reducing end of polysaccharide differs from the one in another position.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	21	5	1	In conclusion, there are different linkage possibilities (plus already identified) to different monosaccharides in different ring positions.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	21	5	1	This gives rise to a multiplicity of signals (not fully identified in this work), which could produce different H1/H2 correlations.

Author	Reviewer_1	4	25	5	1	About the COSY spectrum discussion, only a minor and partial discussion is presented that can be found below the Scheme in manuscript: “In the COSY spectrum, it was found its α-configuration by low-field H-1 signal at δ 5.34 and correlated with H-2 (δ 4.0), H-6 (δ 3.98 and 3.85), and H-5 (δ 4.12) (Speciale et al., 2022).”

Author	Reviewer_1	4	33	5	1	Finally, we kindly request the reviewer to consider that this is the first approach to studying a Chilean hot spring EPS isolation and its functional characterization.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	33	5	1	We also mention that further work to fully reveal this EPS structure will be necessary using higher resolution NMR spectra combined with chemical techniques.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	33	5	1	This work has given partial structural elucidation, which can be considered a previous background for other research on this topic.
