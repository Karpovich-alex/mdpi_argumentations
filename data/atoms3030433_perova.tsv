					0	Numerical simulations predict quasi-random jumps to neighbouring lattice sites at regular time intervals leading to diffusive motion over long times.
					0	Analytic approximations of the effective trapping forces give some insight into the origin of the special form of the optical potential and delineate the regimes in which random walks are expected to occur.The proposal of this somewhat unconventional random-walk regime in cavity-QED is interesting and deserves publication.
					0	The numerical and analytical analysis is thorough, and the manuscript is quite well written.
					0	The authors could help readers by better putting their work into context and improving some of their explanations.
					0	Detailed comments: (1)
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	It remains unclear how the quantum regime (with coherent spatial delocalization and interference of probability amplitudes of different paths) could possibly be reached in a real experiment, as spontaneous scattering of photons (of the cavity light or of the side pumper) into free space would localize the atomic wavefuction into one lattice site and thus decohere any spatial delocalization.

					0	(3)
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	"In Section I the authors write: ""The mechanism is similar to the ones exploited in the creation of artificial potentials in optical lattices [17]""."
					0	This statement is a bit misleading since [17] OPEN ACCESS R2 uses coherent (quantum-mechanical) tunnelling with complex tunnel amplitudes, whereas the present manuscript deals with classical trajectories and classical jump probabilities.
					0	"(4) ""This is similar to previous works on implementation of the quantum random walk with photons [18], atoms in optical lattices [19], ions in traps [20] or on a one-dimensional lattice of superconducting qubits [21]"": This statement is also misleading, because the cited references have reached the coherent quantum walk regime, while the present manuscript only hypothesizes about an (unspecified) possibility to enter the quantum regime."

Reviewer_1	Author	1	5	0	2	In Section II it should be clearly stated that this is a one-dimensional model, transverse forces or motion are not considered.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	"2: ""such that c < 0 corresponding to the stable regime of cavity QED with moving atoms"": what does this mean?"
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	The regime of cavity cooling?
					0	(7)
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	In Section III the numerical value of \kappa is not given (only in the caption of Fig.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	3 it is mentioned that \kappa is set to unity).
					0	(8)
Reviewer_1	Author	1	8	0	2	The numerical values of the parameters used for the simulation are in the bad cavity regime (g << \kappa, \gamma).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	8	0	2	Does the special spatio-temporal shape of the potential, which is shown in Fig.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	8	0	2	3, and which enables the effective random walk motion, originate in genuine cavity quantum effects, or could a similar potential be generated also in the classical (bad cavity) limit (g -> 0, \eta_L -> infinity and \kappa large), or for a classical standing wave laser beam interfering with a classical transverse running wave?
					0	(9)
Reviewer_1	Author	1	9	0	2	In describing the action of the optical potential as quasi-random potential kicks, is there some long-term heating effect (i.e.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	9	0	2	an increase of the average energy of the atom)?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	9	0	2	Does cavity cooling play a role to counteract this in the numerical simulations?Response Response We thank the referee for an extremely careful reading of the manuscript, his/her appreciation of it and for the very constructive criticism expressed in this report.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	We agree with the referee that in any open system as we have here , information will leak out and a corresponding backaction on the wavefunction cannot be avoided.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	However, by operating with ultra-cold quantum particles far of any internal resonance, the coherence time can be pretty long.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	This was shown with BEC’S trapped in cavities (see e.g.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Ref 9).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	The effect of localization via cavity transmission can be reduced by working at higher cavity photon numbers.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Ultimately the interplay between measurement induced localization and coherence spreading by unitary evolution could be one of the most interesting points in setting up such an experiment.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	One should study a transition from classical to quantum behavior depending on the degree of observation of the system.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	We have reformulated to avoid confusion and unsubstantiated claims: “The mechanism is reminiscent of the one exploited in the creation of artificial potentials in optical lattices~\cite{Struck2012Tunable} applied here to the classical regime”
					0	R3 (4)
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	We have rephrased: “In this sense, this work is a stepping stones towards a proposal for implementing a quantum random walk mirroring progress already achieved with photons…”.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	We have added a clarifying statement in the beginning of section 2: “We consider an effective one-dimensional model”.
					0	(6)
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	The referee is correct; in the convention that we specify the negative detuning corresponds to the regime where motional instabilities are avoided and cavity cooling is possible.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	We included this in the figure caption.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	As we specify now in the beginning of section 3: “We treat $\eta_T$ as a free varying parameter.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	In the following we set $\kappa=1$ for numerical simulations and normalize the time in units of $\kappa^{-1}$”.
					0	(8)
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	As the referee correctly infers the random walk is merely an effect of the time modulation of the potential.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	The classical limit without time delayed action (characteristic of the cavity) will reproduce the kind of walk obtained in the LT limit where Fig.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	3 and the analysis has been performed.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	The other regime where the transverse field kicks the particle out of the longitudinal trap is a cavity effect as the effective force (transverse) has a different modulation than the simple cosine of the free space transverse wave.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	However, for fine tuning of parameters and to insure stability of trajectories we have used the cavity cooling effect.
					0	(9)
Author	Reviewer_1	2	9	9	1	Yes, some momentum diffusion can be expected.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	9	9	1	In principle using a sufficiently narrow cavity and suitable operation parameters cavity cooling could be tuned to cancel such unwanted heating.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	9	9	1	However, this is connected to dissipative dynamics and will change the effective operating parameters of the system.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	9	9	1	In the bad cavity limited on the other hand, one can expect some “cavity heating” instead of cooling, but the rate of this heating should be slow enough to allow for many kicks before it gets relevant.
					0	Reviewer 2: Report and Author Response The manuscript reports a theoretical study of the dynamics of an atom inside a time-dependent optical potential, generated in a two-color pumped cavity.
					0	The simultaneous driving at two different frequencies gives rise to interference terms in the optical force acting on the particle.
					0	In particular, a force term contains a time modulation at the beat note between the two frequencies of the pump fields.
					0	The consequence is a sign change in the effective potential that induces the atom to perform an erratic motion, hopping between neighbouring lattice sites.
					0	The resulting trajectory closely resembles a random walk.
					0	In this respect the Authors meet their goal to provide a possible quantum optical setting for the observation of a classical random walk.
					0	Indeed, the analysis here is restricted to the classical regime for both the field and atomic variables.
					0	However, the Authors outline possible generalizations to the quantum regime in the concluding section.
					0	The manuscript is generally well organized and clearly written.
					0	The idea is clever and original and lends itself to further extensions: for instance, to simulate a kicked rotor, by means of a frequency comb drive, or towards hybrid optomechanics, when the two-level atom is replaced by a doped nano-sphere.
					0	The approach is scientifically sound and convincing.
					0	Therefore, the manuscript is worthy of publication.
					0	R4 However, I have a few comments and suggestions to improve the overall quality and readability of the paper.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	In the paragraph following Eq.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	(2), please check the commutation relations between the raising (sigma^+) and lowering (sigma^-) operators and the Pauli matrix sigma^z.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	I suspect it should be [sigma^+,sigma^z] = - 2 sigma^+ and [sigma^-,sigma^z] = + 2 sigma^- .

Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	In the equations of motion for the atoms [Eqs.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	(6) and (7)] it is introduced the quantity gamma, which, I guess, is the atomic decay rate.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	Please, provide a definition of gamma.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	What is, if any, the role of gamma (spontaneous atomic decay rate) in the physical process under consideration?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	In the analytical results, derived in the adiabatic limit, gamma is eliminated and does not play any role.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	I wonder if one can draw any conclusion from the numerical simulations, where other regimes could have been explored.

Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	I'm afraid there is a factor k missing (simple dimensional analysis shows that something is wrong with it).
Reviewer_2	Author	1	5	0	2	The same argument (dimensional analysis) applies to Eqs.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	12	3	1	We have added the definition for \gamma in the text.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	12	3	1	Here we focus on a dispersive regime of weak atomic excitation, where the so called dipole force dominates the mechanical atom field interaction and spontaneous emission plays a negligible role.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	12	3	1	In this limit the mechanical forces can be derived from a deterministic (time dependent) optical potential (see refs.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	12	3	1	7-9 for details).
Author	Reviewer_2	2	12	3	1	However, as the referee points out, in the nonlinear dynamical regime, the effects stemming from the inclusion of a random spontaneous emission could be amplified.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	12	3	1	A similar randomness is connected to cavity cooling in a regime of weak coherent intra-cavity fields.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	12	3	1	This certainly will have to be considered in a quantum treatment.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	12	3	1	In our simulation we got the “quasi random” dynamics from deterministic motion connected to details of the initial conditions without including random forces.

					0	The R6 emergence of the jump regime is directly connected with the increase of the LT force to the value of the longitudinally-induced force but the fine tuning of the parameters is a bit tricky in order to insure that only jumps to neighbouring sites occur.
					0	Therefore we have restricted our presentation to the other regime where the jumps are strictly occurring owing to the transverse-longitudinal time modulation of the potential.
