Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	The definition of biophilia is described as an “inherent love” toward nature.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	While this is somewhat accurate, it might be more appropriate to elucidate this as an “inherent affinity”.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	P2, 47-53: Although in the past there were few guidelines, nowadays, there may be more standards that focus on nature integration within the built environment.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	WELL v2 has several features for Nature and Mind, and Biophilia – Parts I and II, with quantitative assessment methods provided.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Similarly, the Green Mark system uses the green plot ratio, assigning credits to greenery provision to enhance biodiversity and visual relief.
					0	Other standards likely incorporate biophilic elements in building architecture and could be worth highlighting.
					0	The general issue raised by the authors do not necessarily imply a lack of guidelines for biophilic design, since there are several readily available, but may point toward prioritization or emphasis of criteria to meet certain varying expectations, which was alluded to on lines 52-53.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	If the authors agree with this, perhaps this could be revised here to reflect this.
					0	Response 3:
Author	Reviewer_3	2	29	10	3	We agree with the comment.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	There are general biophilic design frameworks (e.g., the 24 Biophilic Design Attributes and the 14 Patterns of Biophilic Design) and green building, healthy building standards (e.g., WELL v2 and Singapore Green Mark) that include biophilia into the certification systems in nowadays.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	And the issue raised by the authors is that these biophilic design frameworks (design guidelines or standards) are general design frameworks (design guidelines or standards) which can be applied to all building typologies (i.e., residential buildings, workplaces, retails, etc).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Further research needs to be conducted to develop the design guideline specific for workplace.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	The sentence was rewritten to demonstrate this argument.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Revision in Page 2 Line 56-61: “Although the importance of biophilic design seems to be well-acknowledged, and some international or regional green building and healthy building standards incorporate biophilic design elements into the rating system, such as WELL building standard version 2 and Singapore Green Mark [53].
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	However, further research on developing building typology-based biophilic design guidelines and assessment methods are necessary.” Point 4:
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	P2, L63: Although I wouldn’t completely rule this out, POE surveys may not always provide feedback to the architect, since they are implemented post design-stage and the building would be operated by facility management or the owner.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	In my view, POE information had more utility diagnosing operation problems, which can be solved when running the building, identifying prominent sources of dissatisfaction that can prompt action to resolve these issues.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	P3, L106: While I generally agree with, questions could be raised to whether POE scales should be used to evaluate biophilic design evaluation.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	Biophilic design is known to elicit mental and physical health benefits, as stated by the authors on page 1, lines 29-32.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	Therefore, it would be more appropriate to use psychological scales (e.g.,
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	PANAS or psychological restoration), instead of design orientated question or survey.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	If the authors agree with this, this aspect could be revised.
					0	Response 6:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	Yes, the existing psychological scales are well-developed, but scales for investigating “workplace biophilic design” had not been developed before.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	Hence, in this study, we develop a method that focus on evaluating the biophilic design elements in workplace.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	The major scale of the questionnaire consists of three parts (subscales): general health (GH), nature relatedness (NR), and biophilic design evaluation (BDE).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	The questions in the first and the second subscales are referred to the validated scales--The World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL) and the nature relatedness (NR).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	The third scale is focus on evaluation on the biophilic design elements.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	Hence, the questions in the final section are designed based on the selection of the biophilic design elements/attributes that typically applied in the office design, which are not mentioned in the previous scales.
					0	Point 7:
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	Something I felt would useful would at the beginning would be a clear definition for what “biophilic attributes” refers to.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	Figure 1 provides some insights into this, but these listed attributes span across different domains and the communal features are not that apparent.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	This becomes an issue later, since some aspects referring to biophilic design become unclear.
					0	Response 7:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	The method of selection of the biophilic design attributes/patterns for workplace is: ŸStep one, find out the correlated biophilic design characteristics from the two mainstream biophilic design frameworks.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	ŸStep two, we neglect the patterns which are not representative in office environment (please find the detailed explanations in the respond for Comment #8) and specify the selected design patterns to nine biophilic design attributes.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	The detailed process is shown in Section 2.1 and Figure 1.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	ŸStep three, verify the selection of the nine biophilic attributes matches the validated eight factors that affect workers’ satisfaction and productivity (please find the detailed explanations in the respond for Comment #11).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	In terms of the reviewer think that the listed attributes span across different domains and the communal features are not that apparent, we believe it is due to the research perspective of biophilic design is different from the perspectives of building science and traditional POE studies (please find the detailed explanations in the respond for Comment #9).
					0	Point 8:
Reviewer_1	Author	1	8	0	2	P4, L173-174: The authors state that seven of the patterns from the 14 patterns of biophilic design were discarded.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	8	0	2	If this was the case, then please better articulate its overarching utility in this study, considering that half of the patterns were not relevant to the research scope.
					0	Response 8:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	The authors gave the reason after the sentence in Page 4, Line 173-174 of the original manuscript “Second, the authors neglect seven design patterns from the 14 Patterns of Biophilic Design which are not representative of the workplace design.” to explain why the seven of the patterns from the 14 patterns of biophilic design were discarded: For instance, the patterns “Presence of Water”, “Prospect”, “Refuge”, “Mystery”, and “Risk” (i.e., itemized patterns 5, 11, 12, 13, and 14 in Column B) are recommended but not demonstrative in this building typology (workplace).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	Those are usually applicable in other building typologies, such as hotels or residential.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	To further explain why these patterns are recommended but are discarded: 1) First, these design patterns (i.e., the seven discarded patterns of the 14 biophilic design patterns) are recommended because they are proofed that benefits health.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	2)
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	However, these patterns are not common in most offices.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	For instance, in most cases, the employers would not create an office environment that makes the workers feel “Prospect”, “Refuge”, “Mystery”, and “Risk”.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	3) Therefore, we only included those biophilic design patterns that relatively easy to apply in the workplace (e.g., greenery, natural light, artworks), and discard those which are not representative in an office design.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	And the sentences are revised to further explain the discard of the seven patterns.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	Please see the revised contents in the updated manuscript below: Revision in Page 5 Line 191-197: “For instance, the patterns “Presence of Water”, “Prospect”, “Refuge”, “Mystery”, and “Risk” (i.e., itemized patterns 5, 11, 12, 13, and 14 in Column B) are recommended because they are proofed that benefits health.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	For instance, in most cases, the employers would not create an office environment that makes the workers feel “Prospect”, “Refuge”, “Mystery”, and “Risk”.” Point 9:
Reviewer_1	Author	1	9	0	2	P4, L180-183: In traditional POE studies and general building science research, daylight, thermal comfort, and air-quality, would be considered as indoor environment parameters (as examples, please see refs.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	9	0	2	in comment #4), while office layout and building form would be considered a physical and architectural parameters.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	9	0	2	Reading further to page 5, lines 189-192, the authors begin to suggest to this, but referred to them and others indoor environmental parameters as factors for the workplace.
					0	I would suggest better rationalizing the connections between the nine design parameters to biophilia to make these more overt.
					0	Response 9:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	9	9	1	We believe that there is no conflict between the different classifications.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	9	9	1	The same parameters (e.g., daylight, thermal comfort, and air-quality, office layout and building form) can be classified in different classifications (i.e., the traditional POE frameworks and the biophilic design frameworks) by different perspectives.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	9	9	1	1) From perspective of building science, building performance, and traditional POE, these parameters (e.g., daylight, thermal comfort, and air-quality) are considered as indoor environment parameters, and office layout and building form are considered a physical and architectural parameters.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	9	9	1	2) On the other hand, from the perspective of biophilia and biophilic design, (e.g., factors workers’ satisfaction and productivity), these parameters are re-classified and defined as the factors affecting workplace health.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	9	9	1	Both classifications validated by previous literatures.

					0	After reviewing their revised manuscript, I felt that their responses were on-point and addressed my earlier thoughts.
					0	I also appreciated the level of detail they provided for responses to #10 and #12.
					0	Figure 1, in particular, is now much easier to read and extract relevant information from in the graphical plot.
					0	In general, I felt that there was a significant improvement to their work.
					0	There were two very minor points that I came across, which they may want to reconsider before proceeding with their article.
					0	These are not significant remarks, but nonetheless, might provide further improvements and clarity: Point 1:
Reviewer_1	Author	3	1	0	2	For their response to comment #6, while I generally agreed with the authors, I felt that it didn’t quite address what I tried to originally convey.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	1	0	2	POE scales do not likely target biophilic elements in architectural designs directly, since a direct question (e.g.,
Reviewer_1	Author	3	1	0	2	how satisfied are you with the biophilic features) may not accurately depict every beneficial nuance they offer (e.g.
					0	,
Reviewer_1	Author	3	1	0	2	psychological recovery).
					0	Instead, studies may elect to use, for example, other relatable scales, which may not have originally been designed for POE surveys (e.g.,
Reviewer_1	Author	3	1	0	2	Mayer’s connectedness to nature scale) to help measure them.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	1	0	2	My generally feeling is that scales, from other domains (i.e.,
Reviewer_1	Author	3	1	0	2	outside of POE studies) have been adopted for this reason, and a short sentence explaining the rationale supporting the lack of scales for biophilic design could be provided to briefly mentioned this.
					0	Response 1: Thank you for your comment.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	1	1	1	In this revised version, we further explain the lack of scales for biophilic design evaluation.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	1	1	1	Please find the revised sentences as below: Revision in Page 3 Line 122-128: “Actually, these are standard research methods of investigative POE; nevertheless, there are no existing POE scales that focus on biophilic design in the workplace.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	1	1	1	According to the research objectives of this study (i.e., evaluate the subjective health impacts of biophilic design in workplace), we need to refer the well-developed scales from other disciplinary (e.g., Environmental Psychology).
Author	Reviewer_1	4	1	1	1	And finally, a scale that integrated health evaluation and building environment evaluation (i.e., POE) is developed for investigation.” Point 2: In consideration to their response #8, I understood and agreed with why half the seven of the 14 papers were discarded, but it did not provide much insight into why the Patterns of Biophilic Design was still used.
					0	A more useful example, which may have elucidated this more, was whether: are there too few frameworks available, and/or no others could have been used.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	2	0	2	If this was the case, perhaps this could be succinctly mentioned.
					0	Response 2: Thank you for your suggestions.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	2	2	1	In the revised version, sentences are added to further explain that there are too few framework available, and these two frameworks are the mainstream biophilic design frameworks that are widely applied in the practical biophilic design projects.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	2	2	1	Revision in Page 3 Line 122-128: “The 24 Biophilic Design Attributes and the 14 Patterns of Biophilic Design are the two mainstream biophilic design which are widely applied in the practical biophilic design projects.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	2	2	1	Hence, these two frameworks are the most suitable to be selected as the basis of this experiment.”

					0	This manuscript presents the results for survey studies carried out in two office buildings in Singapore and China.
					0	The method used POE evaluations to determine the impacts of biophilic design on self-reported occupant health and wellbeing, showing possible causal effects as well as some moderating influences across demographics variables.
					0	Biophilic design is certainty an area worthy of interest, and the authors’ endeavours along this research line were appreciated and were something, I felt, contributes the knowledge in this domain.
					0	Upon reviewing this manuscript, there were a few areas that I felt could be improved.
					0	Firstly, the definitions given to the parameters for biophilic design “cross-over” with those found for indoor environment quality (comment #9).
					0	While there is likely some share attributes (e.g.
					0	natural light), I felt this aspect of paper could confuse readers not overly familiar with biophilic concepts.
					0	The two offices present interesting case studies, but it wasn’t made clear why they were selected and how they served the research aim (comment #12).
					0	Explanations here would be welcomed.
					0	Finally, please consider revising some of the statistical analyses, which at present make use of parametric assumptions (comments #13 and #17).
					0	Although this I don’t believe this would be a large undertaking, the analysis would be better served by non-parametric tests due to the level of measurement used (i.e.
					0	5-point scales).
					0	Despite this, I did appreciate the level of detail the analysis went to, and hope that these proposed alterations will benefit the quality of this manuscript.
					0	Some further detailed comments are provided below, along with some suggested references for consideration.
					0	Introduction #1: The definition of biophilia is described as an “inherent love” toward nature.
					0	While this is somewhat accurate, it might be more appropriate to elucidate this as an “inherent affinity”.
					0	#2: P1, L39-41: Please provide references to these frameworks.
					0	Reading further to page 3, I believe these are the 24 biophilic design attributes [ref.
					0	25,39], and the 14 patterns of biophilic design [ref.40].
					0	Further references around the biophilic concept could also be provided, e.g.

					0	Biophilia: Does Visual Contact with Nature Impact on Health and Well-Being?
					0	International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.

					0	Biophilia, biophobia, and natural landscapes.
					0	Ko et al., 2020.
					0	A window view quality assessment framework.
					0	LEUKOS.
					0	The latter reference reviewed many international standards that advocate nature and biophilic design for view and building spaces, with examples given to the Singapore context.
					0	This somewhat overlaps with my next comment.
					0	#3: P2, 47-53: Although in the past there were few guidelines, nowadays, there may be more standards that focus on nature integration within the built environment.
					0	WELL v2 has several features for Nature and Mind, and Biophilia – Parts I and II, with quantitative assessment methods provided.
					0	Similarly, the Green Mark system uses the green plot ratio, assigning credits to greenery provision to enhance biodiversity and visual relief.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Other standards likely incorporate biophilic elements in building architecture, and could be worth highlighting.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	The general issue raised by the authors do not necessarily imply a lack of guidelines for biophilic design, since there are several readily available, but may point toward prioritisation or emphasis of criteria to meet certain varying expectations, which was alluded to on lines 52-53.
					0	If the authors agree with this, perhaps this could be revised here to reflect this.
					0	#4: P2, L63: Although I wouldn’t completely rule this out, POE surveys may not always provide feedback to the architect, since they are implemented post design-stage and the building would be operated by facility management or the owner.
					0	In my view, POE information had more utility diagnosing operation problems, which can be solved when running the building, identifying prominent sources of dissatisfaction that can prompt action to resolve these issues.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	Recently POE studies, also using office data, advocate this as benefit to their implementation, albeit not necessarily being the only reason: Graham et al., 2020.

					0	#5: P3, L92: I think refers to “has helped” given the five decades predating this.
					0	#6: P3, L106: While I generally agree with, questions could be raised to whether POE scales should be used to evaluate biophilic design evaluation.
					0	Biophilic design is known to elicit mental and physical health benefits, as stated by the authors on page 1, lines 29-32.
					0	Therefore, it would be more appropriate to use psychological scales (e.g.
					0	PANAS or psychological restoration), instead of design orientated question or survey.
					0	If the authors agree with this, this aspect could be revised.
					0	Method #7: Something I felt would useful would at the beginning would be a clear definition for what “biophilic attributes” refers to.
					0	Figure 1 provides some insights into this, but these listed attributes span across different domains and the communal features are not that apparent.
					0	This becomes an issue later, since some aspects referring to biophilic design become unclear.
					0	#8: P4, L173-174: The authors state that seven of the patterns from the 14 patterns of biophilic design were discarded.
					0	If this was the case, then please better articulate its overarching utility in this study, considering that half of the patterns were not relevant to the research scope.
					0	#9: P4, L180-183: In traditional POE studies and general building science research, daylight, thermal comfort, and air-quality, would be considered as indoor environment parameters (as examples, please see refs.
					0	in comment #4), while office layout and building form would be considered a physical and architectural parameters.
					0	Reading further to page 5, lines 189-192, the authors begin to suggest to this, but referred to them and others indoor environmental parameters as factors for the workplace.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	9	0	2	I would suggest better rationalising the connections between the nine design parameters to biophilia to make these more overt.
					0	#10:
Reviewer_1	Author	1	10	0	2	Figure 1: The image presenting all the linkages is very interesting and is worth emphasising, but contains an overwhelming degree of information, and the text and line sizes are too small for readership.
					0	Please consider simplifying the figure.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	10	0	2	For example, some text boxes many not need further explanation (e.g.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	10	0	2	presence of water); also the lines connecting column A to the same patterns in column 4 could be colour coordinated.
					0	#11: Table 2: Please consider providing further explanations for this table.
					0	It was not clear what the authors wanted to show.
					0	#12: P8, L245: Please specify why these two offices were of interest (e.g., were they comparable or had specify architectural features worthy of study).
					0	If possible, please provide more characteristics (e.g.
					0	size, floor area, furniture layout (e.g.
					0	open-plan or enclosed), etc.)
					0	for each office.
					0	Later (P10, L299), it says 201 questionnaires were collected, with 161 occupants taking part in the Singaporean office.
					0	This led me to believe that this office was much larger than the building studied in China.
					0	An image showing the indoor conditions and outdoor façade for each might be beneficial.
					0	Many of the explanations found in section 3.1 could be moved into this part of the manuscript, since they many describe and show the existing office conditions and to do necessarily form part of the main results.
					0	Results #13: Section 3.3.
					0	Although I appreciated the thoroughness to which the descriptive statistical was explained, I wasn’t convinced the mean was the best indicator for the data, considering that evaluation scores were collected on a 5-point scale and not a continuous linear one.
					0	In-lieu of the mean, please consider using the median and inter-quartile range as the central tendency and dispersion indicators.
					0	Figures 1 and 4 can be removed, as the assumption of normality no longer applies (also on P15, L399-400), or replaced with boxplots.
					0	#14: Table 8: Please consider applying benchmarks for what constitute reasonable levels for internal consistency, when using the Cronbach’s Alpha (e.g.
					0	α>0.7): Please see, for example: Taber, 2018.

					0	#15: Figure 3.
					0	The plot is well presented.
					0	A few minor notes for improvement: 1) Please consider adding short or abbreviated labels referring to the actual question, instead of codes (e.g.
					0	GH3-Q10).
					0	This would make it easier for the reader; 2) Round the percentages to the nearest whole number.
					0	#16: P17, L434: Please correct the unfortunate citation error on this line.
					0	#17: P18, section 4.2: Similar to comment #13, the data may be more suited to a Spearman’s correlation test, instead of the Pearson’s correlation coefficient.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	17	0	2	Due to the reasonable size of the dataset collected, it may not change the interpretation, but would help improve the analytical rigour.
					0	#18:
Reviewer_1	Author	1	18	0	2	P18, L448-450: Please check whether the sentence is accurate, and correct the table caption numbers; I believe these should be Tables 10 and 11 and 12, not 1, 2 and 3.
					0	The sentence reads: Homogenous subsets with significant discrepancies (differences?)
					0	across subsets, leading to no significant differences across subsets.
					0	The above is not easy to grasp.
					0	If the information is accurate, please consider amending this to make this clearer.
					0	Conclusions #19:
Reviewer_1	Author	1	19	0	2	While the conclusions were well structured, I felt the authors could have highlighted more the main takeaway messages from their endeavours, in particularly the relationship between biophilic design and occupant health and wellbeing.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	19	0	2	This seems to be a core aspect of their work, but did really emerge from the final section of their work in the same way it was emphasised in the abstract.
					0	The study about the evaluation of biophilic attributes in the workplace for improving health and wellbeing is actual and interesting and therefore the paper is fulfilling the scientific criteria in order to be published.
					0	Practical methodologies to establish biophilic design frameworks for specific workplace typology
					0	Comments for buildings-1613867.
					0	The paper discusses the impacts of biophilic design attributes in offices on workers’ health and wellbeing.
					0	The paper is clear and informative.
					0	In this paper, through two practical study some results of persuasive and constructive significance.
					0	However, some parts of the article which can be optimized.
					0	1.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	1	0	2	"The introduction can be optimized appropriately.The introduction of the term ""Biophilia"" can be more detailed and easy to understand .By contrast, the introduction of “Biophilic Design”is very substantial.It may be better to find some literature to combine workplace design and “Biophilic Design”,and then to explore the relationship between them."
					0	2.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	2	0	2	The illustrations in the article are small and a bit vague,some pictures can shrink a little, not to the top to the border,these can be optimized.
					0	3.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	3	0	2	Overall work of the article is sufficient, the results is has the certain significance, but its limitation is obvious to all.
					0	Some of the results in the illustrations are obvious and can be reduced to less elaboration.
					0	4.The result of biophilic design frameworks for specific workplace typology is of certain value.
					0	The location of the workplace selected in this article is limited, the related biophilic factors are scientifically screened, and the researchers have made a detailed classification study.
					0	However, the huge research scope has certain obstacles to the relevant results, and the general and targeted conclusions will be worse.
					0	It is best to supplement and describe the necessity of research.
					0	At the same time, it will be more complete if the results are reflected in the summary.
					0	The object of the questionnaire should be composed of people with different ages and genders, which is best explained in the article.
					0	Adding some explanations, examples and data comparison to the conclusion will be more intuitive and convincing, just as discussed earlier in the article.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	7	0	2	Perhaps this makes this article more complete and credible.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	7	0	2	At the same time, the conclusion only summarizes the article, and lasks discussions and explanations for the future research direction.
					0	The theoretical part of the presentation is extensive, but the application part is relatively poorly described
Reviewer_3	Author	1	9	0	2	It is better to supplement the temperature, humidity and other parameters of the selected office in the part of the experiment, so as to facilitate readers' reference rather than just giving the location.
					0	The author can think about the impact of such a pro biological design model on the psychology of different experimental personnel.
					0	I think psychological factors will also affect human physiological comfort.
					0	I would like to thank the authors for taking all my comments into full consideration.
					0	After reviewing their revised manuscript, I felt that their responses were on-point and addressed my earlier thoughts.
					0	I also appreciated the level of detail they provided for responses to #10 and #12.

					0	There are general biophilic design frameworks (e.g., the 24 Biophilic Design Attributes and the 14 Patterns of Biophilic Design) and green building, healthy building standards (e.g., WELL v2 and Singapore Green Mark) that include biophilia into the certification systems in nowadays.
					0	And the issue raised by the authors is that these biophilic design frameworks (design guidelines or standards) are general design frameworks (design guidelines or standards) which can be applied to all building typologies (i.e., residential buildings, workplaces, retails, etc).
					0	Further research needs to be conducted to develop the design guideline specific for workplace.
					0	The sentence was rewritten to demonstrate this argument.
					0	Revision in Page 2 Line 56-61: “Although the importance of biophilic design seems to be well-acknowledged, and some international or regional green building and healthy building standards incorporate biophilic design elements into the rating system, such as WELL building standard version 2 and Singapore Green Mark [53].
					0	However, further research on developing building typology-based biophilic design guidelines and assessment methods are necessary.” Point 4: P2, L63: Although I wouldn’t completely rule this out, POE surveys may not always provide feedback to the architect, since they are implemented post design-stage and the building would be operated by facility management or the owner.

					0	Response 5: The sentence was rewritten in the updated version.
					0	Revision in Page 3 Line 109: “It has helped experts to obtain user’s feedbacks over the last five decades [31,32].” Point 6: P3, L106: While I generally agree with, questions could be raised to whether POE scales should be used to evaluate biophilic design evaluation.
					0	Biophilic design is known to elicit mental and physical health benefits, as stated by the authors on page 1, lines 29-32.
					0	Therefore, it would be more appropriate to use psychological scales (e.g., PANAS or psychological restoration), instead of design orientated question or survey.
					0	If the authors agree with this, this aspect could be revised.
					0	Response 6: Yes, the existing psychological scales are well-developed, but scales for investigating “workplace biophilic design” had not been developed before.
					0	Hence, in this study, we develop a method that focus on evaluating the biophilic design elements in workplace.
					0	The major scale of the questionnaire consists of three parts (subscales): general health (GH), nature relatedness (NR), and biophilic design evaluation (BDE).
					0	The questions in the first and the second subscales are referred to the validated scales--The World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL) and the nature relatedness (NR).
					0	The third scale is focus on evaluation on the biophilic design elements.
					0	Hence, the questions in the final section are designed based on the selection of the biophilic design elements/attributes that typically applied in the office design, which are not mentioned in the previous scales.
					0	Point 7: Something I felt would useful would at the beginning would be a clear definition for what “biophilic attributes” refers to.
					0	Figure 1 provides some insights into this, but these listed attributes span across different domains and the communal features are not that apparent.
					0	This becomes an issue later, since some aspects referring to biophilic design become unclear.
					0	Response 7: The method of selection of the biophilic design attributes/patterns for workplace is: Step one, find out the correlated biophilic design characteristics from the two mainstream biophilic design frameworks.
					0	Step two, we neglect the patterns which are not representative in office environment (please find the detailed explanations in the respond for Comment #8) and specify the selected design patterns to nine biophilic design attributes.
					0	The detailed process is shown in Section 2.1 and Figure 1.
					0	Step three, verify the selection of the nine biophilic attributes matches the validated eight factors that affect workers’ satisfaction and productivity (please find the detailed explanations in the respond for Comment #11).
					0	In terms of the reviewer think that the listed attributes span across different domains and the communal features are not that apparent, we believe it is due to the research perspective of biophilic design is different from the perspectives of building science and traditional POE studies (please find the detailed explanations in the respond for Comment #9).
					0	Point 8: P4, L173-174: The authors state that seven of the patterns from the 14 patterns of biophilic design were discarded.
					0	If this was the case, then please better articulate its overarching utility in this study, considering that half of the patterns were not relevant to the research scope.
					0	Response 8: The authors gave the reason after the sentence in Page 4, Line 173-174 of the original manuscript “Second, the authors neglect seven design patterns from the 14 Patterns of Biophilic Design which are not representative of the workplace design.” to explain why the seven of the patterns from the 14 patterns of biophilic design were discarded: For instance, the patterns “Presence of Water”, “Prospect”, “Refuge”, “Mystery”, and “Risk” (i.e., itemized patterns 5, 11, 12, 13, and 14 in Column B) are recommended but not demonstrative in this building typology (workplace).
					0	Those are usually applicable in other building typologies, such as hotels or residential.
					0	To further explain why these patterns are recommended but are discarded: 1) First, these design patterns (i.e., the seven discarded patterns of the 14 biophilic design patterns) are recommended because they are proofed that benefits health.
					0	2) However, these patterns are not common in most offices.
					0	For instance, in most cases, the employers would not create an office environment that makes the workers feel “Prospect”, “Refuge”, “Mystery”, and “Risk”.
					0	3) Therefore, we only included those biophilic design patterns that relatively easy to apply in the workplace (e.g., greenery, natural light, artworks), and discard those which are not representative in an office design.
					0	And the sentences are revised to further explain the discard of the seven patterns.
					0	Please see the revised contents in the updated manuscript below: Revision in Page 5 Line 191-197: “For instance, the patterns “Presence of Water”, “Prospect”, “Refuge”, “Mystery”, and “Risk” (i.e., itemized patterns 5, 11, 12, 13, and 14 in Column B) are recommended because they are proofed that benefits health.
					0	However, these patterns are not common in most offices.
					0	For instance, in most cases, the employers would not create an office environment that makes the workers feel “Prospect”, “Refuge”, “Mystery”, and “Risk”.” Point 9: P4, L180-183: In traditional POE studies and general building science research, daylight, thermal comfort, and air-quality, would be considered as indoor environment parameters (as examples, please see refs.
					0	in comment #4), while office layout and building form would be considered a physical and architectural parameters.
					0	Reading further to page 5, lines 189-192, the authors begin to suggest to this, but referred to them and others indoor environmental parameters as factors for the workplace.
					0	I would suggest better rationalizing the connections between the nine design parameters to biophilia to make these more overt.
					0	Response 9: We believe that there is no conflict between the different classifications.
					0	The same parameters (e.g., daylight, thermal comfort, and air-quality, office layout and building form) can be classified in different classifications (i.e., the traditional POE frameworks and the biophilic design frameworks) by different perspectives.
					0	1) From perspective of building science, building performance, and traditional POE, these parameters (e.g., daylight, thermal comfort, and air-quality) are considered as indoor environment parameters, and office layout and building form are considered a physical and architectural parameters.
					0	2) On the other hand, from the perspective of biophilia and biophilic design, (e.g., factors workers’ satisfaction and productivity), these parameters are re-classified and defined as the factors affecting workplace health.
					0	Both classifications validated by previous literatures.
					0	Point 10: Figure 1: The image presenting all the linkages is very interesting and is worth emphasizing, but contains an overwhelming degree of information, and the text and line sizes are too small for readership.

					0	The questionnaire results reveal that the employees from the understudy companies hold a relatively positive opinion on wellbeing, nature-relatedness, indoor environmental quality, and biophilic design for their health promotion.
					0	According to the arrangement, at the top of this, stacked graph are the evaluation of satisfaction of the work capacities and relationships in the workplace.
					0	About 73.2% of respondents agree that the workers of the companies under investigation are satisfied with their work capacity (GH3-Q10) and relationships (GH4-Q11).
					0	In the subscale nature relatedness, 62.2% and 61.7% of workers responded (agree/strongly agree) that their actions affect the environment (NR2-Q13), and they take notice of the wildlife in their daily lives (NR3-Q14).
					0	Nevertheless, only 47.8% of them selected agreed/strongly agree regarding the statements that their ideal spot for vacation would be a wilderness area (NR1-Q12).
