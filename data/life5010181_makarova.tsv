					0	Produces a dynamic model for chemical evolution rather than traditional deterministic, static, systems that requires centralised information to direct evolution, such as a constant gradient.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	Very well presented, clear and graphically illustrated experimental findings that make a clear case for the model.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	Also a very thorough understanding of the limitations of the system are presented as well as proposals for even more complex instabilties that may underpin lifelike events.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	Overall a beautifully written, wonderfully presented, paper with clear concepts, methods and proposals that significantly contribute to original knowledge in the field.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	This review does not require any action on our part.
					0	Round 1: and Author Response The article “Emergent Chemical Behaviour in Variable-Volume Protocells” focuses on the consequences that a changing volume may have on a set of reactions encapsulated within a semipermeable vesicle; in particular, this kind of compartment can degenerate existing bistable reactions, or promote emergent bistability from very simple reactions, which are not bistable in bulk conditions.
					0	Remarkably, even reaction systems that have no chemical species in common could become R2 indirectly coupled to each other through the volume they share, by means of a sort of osmotic coupling.
					0	The authors discuss these issues by means of differential equations and simulations.
					0	The article is clear and well-written.
					0	The mathematical methods used to deal with the problem are based on approximations and require the support of a huge number of simulations; on the other side, the approximations themselves constitute an interesting feature of the article and allow interesting discussions on the involved physical situations.
					0	As the authors acknowledge, the article is the first step toward a more complete understanding of an interesting class of possible chemo-physical phenomena.
					0	I have few question/comments: •
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	The authors write: “In these initial stages, the emergence of bistability will serve as a proxy for the emergence of other chemical novelties in the vesicle reactor model.” The authors probably means that the existence of more than one stable regime could consent regime changes, but this situation do not indicates how these changes appear: in the article, the change is stimulated by means of a deliberated injection of chemical substances from outside.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	So, I think that the appearance of novelties requires a different order of considerations, whereas the bistability plays possibly the role of novelties amplification and consolidation (in particular conditions).
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	The same observation can be done for the word “innovation”, used on the abstract and at Line 45.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	In order to avoid misunderstandings, I think that the authors should avoid these expressions, ad use the words “regime change”, or similar concepts.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	2	1	1	Here, the reviewer did not like our use of the particular words “novelty” and “innovation”.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	2	1	1	o Use of the word novelty − Instances of “chemical novelty” in the manuscript replaced by “emergent chemical behaviour”.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	2	1	1	− On Page 8, after Equation 8, we removed sentence: The emergence of bistability will serve as a proxy for the emergence of other chemical novelties in the vesicle reactor model.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	2	1	1	Replaced whole paragraph, to read: In particular, in these initial stages, we will focus on the emergence of bistability in the vesicle reactor model—a dynamical feature deducible directly from the number and stability of the fixed points present (i.e., two asymptotically stable points separated by an unstable saddle point).
Author	Reviewer_2	2	2	1	1	We also expect that more complicated dynamical regimes could also be present in the model, like multi-stability or global phase space features such as limit cycles giving rise to sustained oscillations.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	2	1	1	However, investigation of these regimes will be deferred to later work: for the time being, the “emergent chemical behavior” referred to in the title will be restricted to bistability.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	2	1	1	We think this is a clearer explanation, and also uses the word “regime” suggested by the reviewer.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	2	1	1	o Use of the word innovation We kept the 2 occurrences of the word “innovation” in the abstract and the introduction.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	2	1	1	An innovation is defined as a “new method, idea or product” in the dictionary.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	2	1	1	We use the word to refer to new emergent chemical behaviour that the whole vesicle system exhibits (e.g., expanded steady states), which did not exist before.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	2	1	1	We think the use of this word is acceptable.

Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	Note 4 presents a very important issue: why the inner chemical environment is different from the external one, if the running chemical reactions are the same?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	The presence of particular features of the vesicle interior or of entrapped catalysts seem a too easy and ad hoc hypothesis.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	A useful reference proposing an explanation of this symmetry breaking (without requiring different conditions in internal and external environments) could be “R.

					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	3	2	1	we added a new footnote, to explain our standing on this issue: Reference 36: In this work, concentrations outside the vesicle are set as system parameters.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	3	2	1	However, we make no commitment to the type of environment the vesicle is embedded in or how these concentrations are maintained.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	3	2	1	Our purpose is simply to show that bistability can exist in the model for certain sets of outside concentrations.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	3	2	1	Exploration of the model in explicit environments is deferred to future work.

Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	How the authors derive the range [0.9, 101/3] for the so called “reduced surface” index?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	In Figure 1d, Lines 21/3 and 41/3 have some particular meanings, or are plotted mainly to ease the figure comprehension?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	Could the authors add some indications about the derivation of these upper limits?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	4	3	1	Reference 11 has been added after Equation 10, to point the reader to where to find information about phi limits was first discussed.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	4	3	1	Repeating this information here would complicate the paper.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	4	3	1	The lines Phi = 2^(1/3) and 4^(1/3) in Figure 1d have now been explained.

Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	The authors write (case 1): “of the 5000 parameter set tested under constant surface area, 82% (4098) gave a single fixed point, 321 15.7% (785) gave two fixed points, and 2.3% (117) no fixed points.” How this statistics compare with a similar one, performed on a similar chemical situation without container?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	Could the authors add the results of the same within a not confined environment?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	5	4	1	It is difficult to make a direct and meaningful comparison like this.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	5	4	1	Without a container, the reaction system has less parameters, and thus the sampled parameter space is smaller.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	5	4	1	The aim in the paper, was to simply show that encapsulating a Schlogl model which was bistable in bulk condition, seemed to destroy this bistability.
					0	Other minor issues: •
Reviewer_2	Author	1	5	0	2	Line 89: “where the vesicle has again fixed surface area, but now variable volume” should be: “where the vesicle has again fixed surface area, but not variable volume”.
