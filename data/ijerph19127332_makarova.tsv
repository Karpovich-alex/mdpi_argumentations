					0	Point 1、This study estimated the heavy metal exposure to children through soil and dust Ingestion in electronic waste (e-waste) dismantling areas.
					0	The results provided insights into the varying health risks of different have metals.
					0	I suggested the major revision before publication.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	The authors should provide detailed data about the concentration of heavy metals in soil and biotic samples.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	The authors were suggested to introduce the spatial variation of heavy metal in samples, and to analyze the possible factors contributing to the concentration profile of heavy metals in differnt samples.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	The authors should add section(s) for the heavy metal concentrations in biotic samples.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	As an example, they may analyze the influences of food intake and food intake on heavy metal exposure.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	25	14	1	Thank you for your advice.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	25	14	1	At first, the soil heavy metal data has been added in the supporting information (Table S4 and S5).
Author	Reviewer_2	2	25	14	1	Besides, our study focuses on estimating the children’s SIRs of from e‒waste disassembly areas by collecting and analyzing selected tracer elements in matched samples of their consumed food, feces, and urine, as well as soil samples from their play areas.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	25	14	1	We have examined the tracer elements in the food.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	25	14	1	And when we calculated the SIR, we also used the parameter “Cfood” (equation 1) to analyze the food intake.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	25	14	1	In addition, children’s feces and urine belong to biological samples, which is sufficient to calculate the SIR.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	25	14	1	Application of more biotic samples that you suggested is useful for our study, however, it is hard to get other samples from children, such as blood and tissue.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	25	14	1	At last, we also added the heavy metals information in resident or park green areas: “In resident and park green areas, the highest concentration of heavy metals is Zn and the lowest is Cd.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	25	14	1	The concentrations of heavy metals in park green areas were slightly higher than that in residential area, which may attribute to the difference of soil environmental quality management and control policy between these areas.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	25	14	1	Integrated data from the resident and park green areas, the median concentrations (mg/kg) of Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, and Pb were 48.8, 63.9, 128, 413, 6.30, 0.513, and 115, respectively.” Point 2.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	Lines 116-118: The amounts of samples were confused.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	Although there were 66 children involved in this study, 66 food samples, 62 feces and 64 urine samples were collected.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	Thanks for your reminder.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	In our study, 66 children were taken part in our analysis.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	But we failed to get all children’s feces and urine sample every day.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	Thus, we collected sample number was less the involved 66 children.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	In the manuscript, the data is with outlier.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	However, we used the data without outlier to construct the figure.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	At present, the related content in manuscript has been revised to: “The SIR values based on the measured tracer element concentrations of food, feces, urine, soil and dust are presented in Table 1 and Figure 1.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	The median (minimum and maximum) of SIR values were ‒124.3 (‒278.0 to 228.2), ‒210.2 (‒490.1 to 273.8), 27.1 (0.4 to 106.0), ‒22532.8 (‒29443.8 to ‒6215.9), 23.9 (‒45.3 to 268.0), 175.3 (‒56.4 to 1040.7), 39.2 (‒36.4 to 284.0), and ‒263.2 (‒491.4 to 132.3) mg/d for Al, Ba, Ce, Mn, Sc, Ti, Y, and V.” Point 5.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	8	0	2	Lines 218 and 223: check the Figure 3 and figure S1.
					0	Answer: Thank you for your correction.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	We have reorganized the SM figures and the manuscript content.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	The modifications are as follows: “The frequency distribution histograms show few outliers, most being high values (Figure S3 (a) and Figure S4).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	Experimental factors such as measurement error, source error, and transit time misalignment, may lead to some of these outliers.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	Other outliers may be due to the behavior of certain children, such as pica behavior or spending unusually large amounts of time playing in grassland.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	The medians of the SIR values after removing the high values (see Figure S3(b) and Figure 1) were taken as the final SIR values for children living in the studied e‒waste dismantling site in South China.” Point 7.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	9	9	1	However, since negative SIR values are physically meaningless, the RI of the SIR for children living in e‒waste dismantling sites is 0‒730.4 mg/d.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	9	9	1	In this study, 95th per-centile values (383.3 mg/g) would be as recommended value.” Point 8.

					0	As an example, they may analyze the influences of food intake and food intake on heavy metal exposure.
					0	Answer: Thank you for your advice.
					0	At first, the soil heavy metal data has been added in the supporting information (Table S4 and S5).
					0	Besides, our study focuses on estimating the children’s SIRs of from e‒waste disassembly areas by collecting and analyzing selected tracer elements in matched samples of their consumed food, feces, and urine, as well as soil samples from their play areas.
					0	We have examined the tracer elements in the food.
					0	And when we calculated the SIR, we also used the parameter “Cfood” (equation 1) to analyze the food intake.
					0	In addition, children’s feces and urine belong to biological samples, which is sufficient to calculate the SIR.
					0	Application of more biotic samples that you suggested is useful for our study, however, it is hard to get other samples from children, such as blood and tissue.
					0	At last, we also added the heavy metals information in resident or park green areas: “In resident and park green areas, the highest concentration of heavy metals is Zn and the lowest is Cd.
					0	The concentrations of heavy metals in park green areas were slightly higher than that in residential area, which may attribute to the difference of soil environmental quality management and control policy between these areas.
					0	Integrated data from the resident and park green areas, the median concentrations (mg/kg) of Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, and Pb were 48.8, 63.9, 128, 413, 6.30, 0.513, and 115, respectively.” Point 2.

					0	However, little information is available about the Soil and Dust Ingestion Rates 16 (SIR) of heavy metals in children living in such sites.
					0	This study estimated the soil ingestion of 66 17 children from e‒waste disassembly areas by collecting and analyzing selected tracer elements in 18 matched samples of their consumed food, feces, and urine, as well as soil samples from their play 19 areas.
					0	The concentrations of the tracer elements (including Al, Ba, Ce, Mn, Sc, Ti, Y, and V) in these 20 samples were analyzed.
					0	The SIR was estimated to be 148.3 mg/d (median) and 383.3 mg/d (95th 21 percentile) based on the Best Tracer Method (BTM).
					0	These values are somewhat higher than those 22 observed in America, Canada, and other parts of China.
					0	Health risk assessments showed that Cr 23 presented the greatest carcinogenic risk more than 10‒6 in this typical polluted area, while As was 24 second.
					0	These findings provide important insights into the exposure risks of heavy metals in e‒ 25 waste dismantling sites and emphasize the health risk of Cr and As.

					0	Notably, heavy metal pollution is ubiquitous in the environment and bodies 35 of people living near e‒waste disposal sites [3,4].
					0	Heavy metal elements accumulate in the 36 human body and interfere with the human endocrine system [5], damage the body's car- 37 diovascular and nervous systems [6.7], and can even lead to cancer [8].
