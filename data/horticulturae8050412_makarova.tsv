					0	Is there any published precedent?
					0	Response 4: We feel sorry for the unclear statement.
					0	In a previous study (Ding, 2021), the LlWRKY39 promoter was fused to a pGreenII-0800-LUC vector using a recombinant ligase (Vazyme, Nanjing, China).
					0	The constructed vector and an empty vector (control) were transformed into A. tumefaciens strain GV3101 (pSoup), which was used to transform N. benthamiana leaves.
					0	The LUC signal increased profoundly after subjection to HS (37℃), although under normal conditions (room temperature), the LUC signal was very low, which implied that HS activated the promoter activity of LlWRKY39.
					0	In this study, the experimental operations, reagents and plant materials were were the same as the previous study, except for the different treatment conditions.
					0	Therefore, we suggest that salt stress can induce the activity of the OfSPL11 promoter.
