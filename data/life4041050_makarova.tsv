					0	He reviews some of his previous work and presents an alternative to the dominant ‘Ancient RNA world’ hypothesis.
					0	The alternative views he previously generated are much expanded in this manuscript.
					0	In light of recent research developments and argumentation (some of it reviewed), his views should be considered a welcome addition to the many ideas that populate the “origin of life” field of inquiry that counter the dominant paradigm.
					0	I have however a number of quibbles that if addressed could increase the accuracy, value and impact of the manuscript.
					0	I must note that a careful evaluation of all facets requires expertise in a multitude of disciplines (from prebiotic chemistry and structural biology to evolutionary bioinformatics and biochemistry) and considerable time, none of which I possess.
					0	Therefore, my comments will be slanted by my own expertise and will only serve the author as a partial devil’s advocate effort General commentary
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	Section 1.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	The place of RNA in LUCA (page 2): In search of features that are more conserved (carrying deep phylogenetic memory) than the sequence of genes, Wächtershäuser focuses on a paper of his in Systematic and Applied Microbiology (1998) that uses gene content and order of microbial genomes to make inferences about the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of cellular life.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	He then mines the significance of some of the conserved chromosomal segments in light of some other evidence.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	The exercise is at places compelling, but forgets some recent, very global and exhaustive analyses that also use highly conserved biological features to reconstruct the makeup of LUCA (e.g., gene order, 3D molecular structure, molecular functions).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	See for example PubMed references PMID: 17370266, PMID: 21612591, and PMID: 17908824, which are in line with some conclusions derived from the alignment of Figure 1.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	The fact that these other analyses make use of hundreds of genomes to infer the ancient biochemistry of LUCA complements and strengthens the preliminary and fragmentary analysis of only 19 of them by the author, which also excludes eukaryotic genomes from the set (understandably, few sequenced genomes were available in 1998, and eukaryotes are in general “master rearrangers”).

Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	The three references have been noticed with gratitude and included in the MS.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Given my interest in the bioinformatics of gene content and order, I took the liberty of studying the brief Systematic & Applied Microbiology paper to check the validity of the “reconstruction” methods of Figure 1.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	The algorithmic implementation that is described is quite raw and does not extract important information that is embedded in the clusters of conserved gene segments.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Important algorithms have been devised since the initial work of Sankoff in the sixties and seventies to do exactly that.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	I refer to the work of Pevzner, Tesler and Bourque as good examples, but also of Warnow.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	I also recommend visiting GRIMM (http://grimm.ucsd.edu/GRIMM/) and perhaps using the server to confirm or extract additional information from the alignments that are summarized in Figure 1.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	The Wächtershäuser algorithm makes use of conserved elements of gene content and order but discards information provided by the actual rearrangement operations that erase gene order history.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	The algorithm does not describe how gene homology was detected, how the limited set of genes was selected, and how the alignments were constructed (I imagine by hand).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	It is not clear if a guiding tree was used in the alignment (though this is mentioned in Line 65), since this is not made explicit in the 1998 publication.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	An alignment implies a tree but usually alignment algorithms are greedy and problematic and represent the most important limiting step of a phylogeny (the field is thus moving to the joint alignment and tree reconstruction).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Therefore, I do not think the ancestors were properly reconstructed (the tracing of features in ancestor nodes of trees are not described, nor the actual trees).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Regardless of all of these limitations, the tight conservation of certain segments is enough to show the existence of a core of ribosomal proteins that is universally present in cellular organisms.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	This in itself is valuable.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Of course, a sample of 19 microbes may not be enough to encompass molecular diversity and the absence of Eukarya may also be problematic for any global evolutionary statement.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	In other words, the risks of sampling bias are clearly present and should be mentioned in the manuscript.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	The 1998 paper leaves much to be desired.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Its deficiencies reflect the excitement of the first hour.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	The state of the art at that time may be gleaned from an authoritative paper that came to the opposite conclusion: A.R.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Mushegian and E.V.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Koonin “Gene order is not conserved in bacterial evolution”.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	TIG 1996, 12, 289–290.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	The gene cluster table of 1998 was mainly retrieved from the annotations in published genomes and constructed manually with paper and pencil.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	The state of information technology at that time is reflcted by the fact that the table was folded an individually pasted by hand into each issue by the publisher.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	The list of common genes in the alignment of Table 1 is enriched in small and large subunit ribosomal proteins that are the most ancient of the ribosomal set, according to the Caetano-Anolles theorem that is mentioned later in the manuscript.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Interestingly, the most ancient of them are clustered toward the 5’ end of the genomic sequences that were aligned (S12, S17, S5, S4 and L2, L3 and L24).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Could this imply a possible ancient segmental duplication?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Also interesting is the placement of the most ancient ribosomal protein S12 between exactly two polymerase (beta and beta prime) and elongation factor (entry and translocation) genes (separated by single and much more derived ribosomal proteins).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Could this be an ancient memory of the ribosome mediating translation and replication?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	A commentary would enhance the value of the section.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	The 1998 paper contemplated speculatively a combination of small-scale gene doubling (as evidenced by the immediate neighborhood of EF-Tu/EF-G) and of a large-scale gene cluster doubling (as evidenced by the spacing between secE/secY and rpoH-A/rpoD) with the hope of a future deeper understanding based on folding structures.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Now the referee makes an exciting suggestion that may, if executed successfully, go some way to satisfy that hope.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	In terms of the genome organization of LUCA (Line 105), there are numerous arguments in favor of an RNA ancestral genome and the late unfolding of DNA as genetic repository (perhaps through viruses).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	I cannot understand how 2'-hydroxy groups could destabilize the molecule and lead to “intramolecular self-destruction” (Line 107).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	RNA has the wonderful property of folding in search of energetic and kinetic minima.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	These processes make use of a frustrated landscape, which is powerful in terms of its biological potential (stability, function, information).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	It is much more versatile than the rigid DNA alternative, which is enriched in the ‘information’ capacity.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	None of them have “self destruction” properties, which would have been weeded out by selection and self-organization very early in “chemical” evolution.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	In turn, everything about LUCA should be considered quite modern and far away from an initial FeS world.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	I refer to the work of Daniel Lundin and colleagues in Sweden about the rather late rise of some structures of the ribonuceotide reductase enzymes needed to built the DNA polymers.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	The Maurel theorem stands if one thinks of single genome molecules.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	But what if there were many short RNA genomes, as anticipated by Woese, each perhaps linked to different and ancient tRNA-like cofactors?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	As the author mentions, LUCA is contemporary to a rather complex biochemistry, with numerous structures harboring a multitude of active and allosteric sites in proteins, most of which drive central enzymatic functions.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	The self-cleavage of RNA by 2'-OH is a chemical textbook fact.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	The 2'-OH group has the proper position and orientation for a nucleophilic attack on the phosphate bridge.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	The kinetics of the reaction is greatly favored by the 5-membered ring structure of the resulting cyclic phospho-bisester.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	The length of the RNA molecule is not relevant since each nucleophilic attack causes destruction of the chain.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	The effect should not be confused with the length-dependent “error catastrophe” of accumulating mutations of RNA.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	Incidentally, some anaerobic ribonucleotide reductases are ancient, while others (aerobic ones) are later inventions.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	5	0	2	In Line 114, the role of chromosomal rearrangement in evolution is not well described.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	5	0	2	What are the effects of genome rearrangements?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	5	0	2	Several scenarios are possible, including: (1) Genes remain linked R4 probably because it is more efficient to transcribe genes that produce interacting proteins (part of complexes) than those that are not; (2) Genes remain linked if they are of relatively recent origin (rearrangement has not had the change to split them apart); (3) Genes remain linked if they are part of functional groups historically united by genomic regions (encoding metabolic functions or rRNA?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	5	0	2	); this includes genes sharing an operon structure for economy purposes in highly reduced organisms such as bacteria; (4) Genes remain linked because they originated when genomic rearrangements were not biochemically motivated and their sequence makeup was later refractory to rearrangement hotspots.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	5	0	2	There is a rich literature about rearrangement, hotspots and many processes related to these (including domain organization in proteins).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	5	0	2	Some discussion in this front could be clarifying.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	Genome rearrangements are certainly important during later evolution of the phyla.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	At the level of LUCA, i.e., prior to the splitting of the domains, it is not clear, if and to what extent rearrangements of the modern style occurred.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	In this regard we should bear in mind that the LUCA genome may have exhibited sense-antisense coding on both strands as suggested by Rodin and Carter.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	This position has been adopted and discussed in the present paper.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	Therefore, speculations concerning possible genome rearrangements may be a bridge too far.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	In relation to comments of Line 188 onwards, Di Giulio, Caetano-Anolles and others have suggested that the genetic code started to unfold prior to LUCA but continue to do so once life diversified.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	The corollary, is that the complete canonical set of amino acids may have not been encoded in LUCA.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	In terms of metabolic and biochemical competency, there are numerous and interesting studies, which have not been cited (especially in origins and evolution of modern metabolism).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	This includes the coevolution theory of the genetic code, the coexistence of prebiotic chemistries with modern metabolic reactions (recently studied for nucleotide metabolism), and theories about the origin of translation.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	The present analysis comes to the conclusion that the sets of canonical amino acids and bases as well as the genetic triplet code were largely complete at the level of LUCA.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	The Wong coevolution theory of the genetic code has been discussed in detail.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	The literature comprises numerous proposals concerning the origin of translation and other aspects of the genetic machinery.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	A review of all these proposals and many others is beyond the scope of the present paper.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	The present paper is a research paper and not a review paper.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	It aims at a comprehensive account of early evolution from the origin of life all the way to LUCA.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	This puts a systematic constraint on literature selection.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	An effort (unfortunately fallible) has been made to include all those references that integrate with the main lines of the present account into a coherent account.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	Contributions by others that have the character of theoretical modules that fit well into this account have been termed “theorems” with names of the main authors attached.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	A reference to a paper on nucleotide biosynthesis phylogeny is now cited in Section 7.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	Section 2: Thermal course of evolution (Page 6): Why a focus on thermal energy?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	The framework should be on thermodynamics, energy dissipation and information, all of which are linked.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	What is thermally upward or downward adaptation?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	Is it conquering niches on Earth or a process involving molecular makeup?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	Vocabulary and definitions are murky, especially related to the links of environmental thermal fluctuations, energy of folding and stability of polymers.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	Subsection (1) must be rewritten to help the reader understand the ideas.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	Should all adaptations comply with maximizing energy R5 dissipation?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	How can this be reconciled with upward and downward trends?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	No references are provided despite the rich literature underscoring the controversial link between physics, information theory and biology.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	If the focus is conquering planetary niches, then perhaps reference the contrasting views and some of their proponents (deep sea versus surface; thermophilic versus mesophilic, etc.).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	Further elaboration of the Wolfenden theorem appears relevant and its connections to what is known about the origin and evolution of metabolism also of importance.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	Based on the valuable criticism Section 2 has been extensively revised.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	Terminology has been clarified.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	This Section has a rather restricted purpose.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	It provides chemical arguments for the proposition that the pioneer organisms could only exist at high temperature and that the subsequent forms of life remained hyperthermophilic for a long time until much later an irreversible evolution generated organisms that required lower and lower temperatures.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	This conclusion places severe constraints on all aspects of the evolution of the genetic machinery.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	The fascinating topics of thermodynamics, energy dissipation and information are outside the scope of the paper.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	8	0	2	Section 5.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	8	0	2	Place of RNA in the origin and early evolution of translation/Pre-translational coding of peptides.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	8	0	2	The view that is presented in this crucial segment posits a pre-translational mechanism (side-by-side tRNA mediated coding) that very much resembles the ribosomal entropic system, which could be very advanced.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	8	0	2	What if the pre-translational coding was assembly line-like and mediated by the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases themselves?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	8	0	2	See PMID: 23991065 for one such alternative and a related previous model (PMID: 22210458).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	8	0	2	This would also match commentary of a possible early origin of non-ribosomal peptide synthesis machinery compared to that of the ribosome.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	The author expresses his gratitude for the two additional references, which have been included in the text.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	9	0	2	Section 9.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	9	0	2	General overview.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	9	0	2	While the grand finale “Nothing in evolution makes sense except in the light of chemical predetermination” is impressive and summarizes the championing work of the author, chemical predetermination may apply to the very early stages of evolution and not to many of the stages described in the manuscript.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	9	0	2	How much chemical predetermination can there be with polymers as these explore a minute fraction of the space they make possible?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	9	0	2	In the enthalpic-entropic gradient that is proposed, there is also a gradient from “predetermination” to historical contingency.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	9	0	2	The boundaries of such a gradient is murky and the final statement may not apply to much of modern biochemistry, once proteins start to achieve stable complex structure and much earlier that the time of LUCA.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	9	0	2	In fact, the genome rearrangements that underlie Figure 1 are testament to the historical contingencies that were already at play in LUCA and not to chemical predetermination.

					0	
Reviewer_1	Author	1	14	0	2	Line 52.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	14	0	2	Not only genes are gained and lost with time (Woese theorem), but also mutations accumulate to saturation in genes making homology statements difficult.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	14	0	2	This has been made explicit abundantly in the molecular evolutionary literature.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	14	0	2	A focus on gene content and order makes only sense if such homologies at gene level are preserved (if not there will be artifactual losses in the alignments).This should be highlighted in the text because it is relevant to the validity of the alignment of Figure 1, making its significance more important.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	16	0	2	Why bring LUCA to a link with the proposed “protein cycle”.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	16	0	2	LUCA is just the last of a chain of ancestor of diversified life.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	16	0	2	If the protein cycle requires a coupling of the enthalpic activation of amino acids and the entropic biosynthetic action of a primordial ribosome, then perhaps it is better to call it “ribocellular protein cycle”, since this coupling marks the start of modern cells, not necessarily “modern diversified cells” (i.e., LUCA).
					0	Response
Author	Reviewer_1	2	16	16	1	The author prefers the present title, because the paper is concerned with the origin of the genetic machinery.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	16	16	1	Theories on the origin of life or on other aspects of early evolution, such as cellularization, serve merely as starting points.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	16	16	1	 In the introduction the term “or proteins” has been added after “RNA” ,  and the term “retrodict” has been defined.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	16	16	1	 The term “interpolate” has been clarified.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	16	16	1	 The problem of mutational saturation is now included in the discussion of Figure 1.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	16	16	1	 The term “multiply impaired” has been replaced by a clearer wording.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	16	16	1	 LUCA is discussed only in Section 1.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	16	16	1	 The protein cycle is discussed in a separate Section 4, which is concerned with the course of evolution before LUCA.
					0	Round 1: and Author Response The manuscript comprises an exciting account on the origin of life with emphasis on the emergence and function of RNA.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	17	1	1	There are many relevant literature references.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	17	1	1	Among these there are specific proposals concerning a circumscribed problem that are included to fill a logical gap, as a theoretical module so to speak.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	17	1	1	These have been designated by the term “theorem” with the added name(s) of the main R7 author(s).
