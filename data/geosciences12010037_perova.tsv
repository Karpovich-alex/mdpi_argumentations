Reviewer_2	Author	3	1	0	2	With respect to the helium measurements, the references to the primary documentation requested by the reviewer in comments to v.1 of the manuscript are not provided, nor do the authors provide any comment as to why they deem this unnecessary.
Reviewer_2	Author	3	1	0	2	Section 4.3 Helium concentrations and isotopic composition measured in groundwater, is framed around results from previous studies.
Reviewer_2	Author	3	1	0	2	Providing references to these original studies (including access to the actual data that allow objective verification) rather than referencing to summary papers would be more in line with scientific publishing practice.
Reviewer_2	Author	3	1	0	2	If the primary documentation is not accessible, the authors should state this clearly.
Author	Reviewer_2	4	1	1	1	The helium measurements have been added as supplementary data and the author made a clear difference between this study Helium measurements and other tracer studies we are citing.

					0	: Fault related fluid flow implications for unconventional hydrocarbon development, Beetaloo Sub-basin (Northern Territory, Australia) Summary of content: The study investigates potential connections between unconventional petroleum plays and water assets in the Beetaloo Sub-basin in the Northern Territory, Australia.
					0	Magnetic data and 2D seismic reflection profiles were used to image structural features, and fluid/gas leakage pathways.
					0	Helium content of the aquifer systems was sampled and measured.
					0	Recent fault activity was identified using a combination of sub-surface imaging and comparison of fault orientations and surface drainage networks.
					0	The study concludes that there the shallow aquifers are connected to deep-seated gas source along faults, some of which show evidence of recent movement.
					0	Helium isotope data do not provide an unequivocal answer to whether the gas originates from the unconventional plays or a deeper source.
					0	Although the authors point out that more data is needed to identify the source of the gas, the observations made in this study confirm the presence of fault-controlled fluid flow pathways connecting the stratigraphic levels where the unconventional plays are located with shallower aquifers the Beetaloo basin.
					0	Review summary Scientific aims clearly stated.
					0	The text is well organized and well written.
					0	Methods are sound and clearly described, There are some shortcomings in documentation and presentation of results, which weaken the link between observations and conclusion.
					0	Development of the petroleum resources in this region is controversial and faces opposition from Traditional Owners as well as climate scientists, and environmentalists.
					0	One of the key issues in the Beetaloo Sub-basin, the risk of groundwater contamination from fracking-based production of the unconventional plays.
					0	The present paper is thus part of an ongoing debate and the findings presented here are likely to influence discussions and decisions by stakeholders.
					0	This fact stresses the need for clarity when presenting data and results.
					0	Improving the design of the figures and adding links/references to primary data sources would go a long way towards addressing this.
					0	Conclusions appear supported by the observations made in this study, but presentation of results needs to be improved.

Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	Aeromagnetic survey data acquired over the last 50+ years were employed for mapping structural and lithological features.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	Although the aeromagnetic data is said to be employed for structural interpretation, details somewhat sketchy.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	Reference is made to “…prominent […] magnetic lineaments which can be caused by faulting”, and “…several circular low magnetization anomalies, approximately two kilometers in diameter, aligned with northwest trending lineaments”.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	It would be nice to include a map with these features and lineaments interpreted from the aeromagnetic datasets.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	This would also tie the observations based on this dataset closer to the seismic interpretation (see below).

Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	Helium measurements from groundwater samples.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	With respect to the helium measurements, no detailed documentation of where these samples were collected is provided beyond referring to Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program (2021a) Fact sheet 12, and Geological and Bioregional Assessment Program (2021b) Regional tracer results from the Cambrian Limestone Aquifer.

Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	The drainage network was extracted automatically.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	It is not clear if the “simplified” drainage network shown in Figure 2 was also extracted automatically.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	The data is summarized in Figure 8 (see also comments to Figure 8 below).
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	It is not clear if the surface drainage network line dataset is based on the “unfiltered” or “simplified” data shown in Figure 2.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	Since n=130, one can assume the latter.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	It is however not made clear how this “simplified” network was generated, but there appear to be a substantial number of instances where the “simplification” provides apparent mismatches with the original data (see examples included in comments to Figure 2 below).
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	The accuracy of the resulting plot can therefore be questioned.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	If the “simplified” network was generated automatically, I encourage the authors to do a manual QC of the results.

					0	Outline size modified and homogenised with other figures 4.
					0	Consider using the most prominent colour (red) for the possible fluid escape features as this is the key element of the map.
					0	Bright green might also bee an option.
					0	Red selected 5.
					0	Not possible to differentiate “ntspr_2M_gw” (whatever that is) and “PossibleFluidEscapeStructures” (same colour).
					0	modified The link between interpreted faults and fluid or gas escape features is a key feature of this figure.
					0	The map differentiates between “BaseCambrian seismic faults”, Post-Wilton “Strike-slip” and “Reverse” faults, and “FAULTS”.
					0	The categorization is not adequately explained (e.g.
					0	what differentiates “FAULT” from a “BaseCambrianSeismic fault”?).
					0	modified accordingly Consider adding a simple conceptual sketch highlighting the stratigraphic position of the different faults (and possible fluid escape structures– this would also help visualizing which stratigraphic intervals the potential fluid escapes originate from and which stratigraphic intervals are potentially connected along potential fault-related fluid flow pathways.
					0	With the new classification the reader should be able to better read the paper and can now directly refer to the stratigraphic table Figure 8.
					0	Please provide a more informative caption to what these plots show.
					0	What is included in the “Drainage and structural lineament analysis” plot?
					0	Done, figure clarified as well Figure 9.
					0	Poor resolution in the copy provided for the review.
					0	Consider using higher contrast colours or thicker lines to highlight different faults on the map.
					0	done, we also totally revisited this figure as to have a cleared output I hope you will find these comments useful when revising the manuscript and look forward to seeing the paper published in Geoscience.
					0	Thank you, we truly appreciated the time took by the reviewer to provide detail guidance to improve the manuscript and the figures
