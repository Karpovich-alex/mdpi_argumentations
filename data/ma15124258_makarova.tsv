					0	Review of article entitled: “Investigation on the Evolution of Nano-scale Defects of CL-20 2 Crystals under Thermal Treatment by Wide/Small-Angle X-ray 3 Scattering” Overall, I liked the paper and believe it contributes to our knowledge of thermal evolution of CL-20.
					0	The authors used both WAXS and SAXS to examine CL-20 particles as they were heated from room temperature to around 200C.
					0	The analysis included determination of the number of voids and specific surface area during the heating process.
					0	I had several questions regarding this work: 1.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	How do the WAXS and SAXS differ?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	How do these experiments differentiate between increasing the number of defects and the size of the defects?
					0	2.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	The authors mention cracks as well as voids.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	How are the cracks differentiated from the voids?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Were voids observed?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Could computed microtomography be used to confirm some of the experimental results?
					0	3.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Are your pores assumed to be spherical?
					0	Are cracks cylindrical.
					0	Are they statistical in nature?
					0	4.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	I would be interesting to have additional support for the process by using thermal experiments such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	How do you results compare to phase transformation measured using DSC?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	Are the onsets and finishing of the phase transformations consistent with the DSC measurements?
					0	5.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	5	0	2	Do your experiments (WAXS and SAXS) measure the defect size and number of defects or is a model used to infer these quantities?
					0	6.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	What do the colors in your figures represent?
					0	7.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	Could there be any other explanation rather than increase in number of internal nano-scale pores?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	Could the increase be due to larger defects rather than an increase in the number of defects?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	If so, how do you prove this?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	Could you use X-ray microtomography on your samples?
					0	8.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	8	0	2	Is the temperature high enough to cause decomposition effects?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	8	0	2	If so, do the decomposition products form bubbles in your solvent?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	8	0	2	If so, could this bias your conclusions?
					0	9.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	9	0	2	Can you explain why an increase in scattering intensity indicates increase in more small voids rather than an increase in existing void sizes?
					0	10.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	10	0	2	"Could you be more specific on the ""spherical model"" on line 170?"
Reviewer_1	Author	1	10	0	2	Co you assume the pore volume remains unchanged, but the number increases?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	10	0	2	or visa verse?
					0	11.
					0	What do you mean by “are calculated” on line 199?
					0	What are the basic equations and assumptions for this calculation?
					0	12.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	12	0	2	Again, what is happening?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	12	0	2	Are the number of pores increasing or is the existing pores increasing in volume?
					0	As you can tell by these questions, my main issue is related to the specific form of the thermal damage.
					0	Is it the number of defects that are increasing?
					0	Or, is it the volume of the defect that is increasing?
					0	Or, are both the number and size of the defect increasing.
					0	Do you have another proof for your conclusions.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	13	0	2	I also noticed that your references did not include any of the more recent work published in 2021 or 2022.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	13	0	2	There are some more recent articles that would be worth citing.
					0	The authors present an experimental study of nano-scale defects in CL-20 under heating.
					0	Some changes in propagation of pores caused by both the phase transitions and temperature were observed by an appropriate experimental technique.
					0	Overall, the work is done well and manuscript sounds.
					0	Thus, I can recommend it for publication after a minor revision.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	In the introduction, the authors foreground their work, focusing on the relationship between the presence of pores and sensitivity.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	It indeed the case, but I could not find any discussion on this issue.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	Therefore, I suggest include some comments on this and, probably, provide some discussion of how to avoid the increase of such defects, which increase sensitivity of energetic crystals, in particular CL-20.
					0	The manuscript is devoted to research on the phase transformations of CL-20 at various temperatures.
					0	The nano-scale defects were studied by using Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (WAXS) and Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS), during the temperature range from 30 °C to 200 °C .
					0	I recommend publishing the manuscript after minor the revision.

					0	Response to Reviewer' Comments Dear Reviewer, We sincerely appreciate your comments and suggestions on the manuscript!
					0	Every available suggestion has been answered carefully and corrected in the article.
					0	The corrections are marked in red color.
					0	Question 1.
					0	How do the WAXS and SAXS differ?
					0	How do these experiments differentiate between increasing the number of defects and the size of the defects?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (WAXS) and Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) obey the same Bragg's Law (2dsinθ=nλ), but with different distance from sample to detector.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	With a distance about 384 mm in this work, the WAXS can measure the structure from 0.12 nm to 0.45 nm, which correspond to the crystal lattice, while SAXS can measure the structure from 10 nm to 80 nm, with a distance of 2484 mm.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	In a SAXS curve, the strength reflect the number of defects, while the q range reflect the size of the defects.
					0	Question 2.
					0	The authors mention cracks as well as voids.
					0	How are the cracks differentiated from the voids?
					0	Were voids observed?
					0	Could computed microtomography be used to confirm some of the experimental results?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Thanks for your question, we looked up several literature and couldn't find a fixed usage of cracks and voids, and in this article, we think that using pores would completely cover our research objectives, so we deleted the cracks in this paper.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Computed microtomography is usually used to confirm the voids in micron-scale but this paper focuses on nano-scale voids.
					0	Question 3.
					0	Are your pores assumed to be spherical?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Are cracks cylindrical?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Yes, the pores are assumed to be spherical in the fitting of SAXS data, because the spherical model is the simplest and widely used model in the SAXS fitting.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	The voids are cylindrical that is close to a spherical, so we can get a relatively accurate size distribution by assuming to spherical.
					0	Question 4.
					0	I would be interesting to have additional support for the process by using thermal experiments such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).
					0	How do you results compare to phase transformation measured using DSC?
					0	Are the onsets and finishing of the phase transformations consistent with the DSC measurements?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	Yes, we had an experiment of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to characterize the process, as shown in Figure 1.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	According to the result from DSC, there were an endothermic peak of phase transformation between the temperature range of 151~172 ℃, which are not exactly consistent with the results from in this paper.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	We think the difference in temperature is result from the different sample amount and heating rate.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	As with X-ray diffraction (XRD), the WAXS can be used to characterize the content of different phase in the phase transformation.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	So, we think the results in our paper is reasonable.

					0	The DSC curve of CL-20 powders during thermal process Question 5.
					0	Do your experiments (WAXS and SAXS) measure the defect size and number of defects or is a model used to infer these quantities?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	SAXS can be used to measure the defect size and number of defects with rational theory and adequate validation in many
					0	 field.
					0	Question 6.
					0	What do the colors in your figures represent?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	The colors in figure 1 and 3 represent the strength of scattering, while the colors in other figures just represent different date.
					0	Question 7.
					0	Could there be any other explanation rather than increase in number of internal nano-scale pores?
					0	Could the increase be due to larger defects rather than an increase in the number of defects?
					0	If so, how do you prove this?
					0	Could you use X-ray microtomography on your samples?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	The result of SAXS is a reflection of two-phase with different electron density.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	In our paper, the CL-20 powders are immersed in GPL107 with a approximately equal electron density with CL-20 crystals, so the SAXS reflects the nano-scale pores inside CL-20 powders.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	Thereby, the increase of strength in SAXS curve reflects the increase in number of internal nano-scale pores.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	According to the principle of SAXS, the scale of defects is correlated with the q range, so the growth into larger defects will appear in other q range.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	X-ray microtomography is usually used to confirm the voids in micron-scale but this paper focuses on nano-scale voids.
					0	Question 8.
					0	Is the temperature high enough to cause decomposition effects?
					0	If so, do the decomposition products form bubbles in your solvent?
					0	If so, could this bias your conclusions?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	The GPL107 is resistant to high temperatures about 400 ℃, and we used the SAXS patterns of GPL107 at different temperature as the background to correct any bias at different temperature.
					0	Question 9.
					0	Can you explain why an increase in scattering intensity indicates increase in more small voids rather than an increase in existing void sizes?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	9	9	1	According to the principle of SAXS, the scale of defects is correlated with the q range, so the increase in scattering intensity in lager q range can be explained into the increase in more small voids.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	9	9	1	And also, our fitting result can provide more obvious display.
					0	Question 10.
					0	"Could you be more specific on the ""spherical model"" on line 170?"
					0	Co you assume the pore volume remains unchanged, but the number increases?
					0	or visa verse?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	10	10	1	In our paper, spherical model was just a choice in the SAXS date fitting, so we did not provide more illustrate, but a reference (L A Feigin and D I Svergun, Structure Analysis by Small-Angle X-Ray and Neutron Scattering, Plenum Press, New York, 1987) was provide in the manuscript.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	10	10	1	On line 173, we gave a conclusion “the number of pores increased, but the size distribution did not change.” We did not consider the pore volume, but we can deduce that the pores volume increase as the increase of the number of pores.
					0	Question 11.
					0	What do you mean by “are calculated” on line 199?
					0	What are the basic equations and assumptions for this calculation?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_3	2	17	4	2	In our previous work (Molecules 2020, 25, 443.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	17	4	2	), we described in detail how to calculate the specific surface area and volume fraction.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	17	4	2	In this paper, the same method was used to calculate the specific surface area and volume fraction, so we did not repeat how to calculator, just added the reference in the manuscript.
					0	Question 12.
					0	Again, what is happening?
					0	Are the number of pores increasing or is the existing pores increasing in volume?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	12	12	1	Thanks again for your attention, According to the principle of SAXS, the scale of defects is correlated with the q range, so the increase in scattering intensity without the change of q range can be explained into the number of pores increasing, while the existing pores increasing in volume would result into an change of q to low range.
					0	Question 13.
					0	I also noticed that your references did not include any of the more recent work published in 2021 or 2022.
