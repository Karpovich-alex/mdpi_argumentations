Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	"Introduction Line 31 – ""(4-10 Hz) induced…"" this is not theta range; please correct."
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Thanks for pointing out the error in the range.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Correction made in the text.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Line 32 – add the reference.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Reference added.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Methods Participants Did the authors take note of the menstrual cycle of the female participants?
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	No, we did not.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	We have added a statement in the study limitations to address the issue.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	Although the differences in handedness would not profoundly affect the overall results, can the author check if there were significant differences in stimulation intensity (AMT and RMT) in right and left-handed participants?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	Left-handed individuals often have a high threshold on the left motor cortex.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	The three left-handed participants exhibited rMT and aMt typical of young adults of their age (Right, n=16, mean rMT 42%, aMT, 32%, see below for Left).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	We did not perform bilateral testing, so we cannot comment on hemispheric differences in excitability.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	However, our own investigation on the matter showed that Left-handers had higher rMT on the right hemisphere and, in fact, those individuals exhibited comparable rMT on the left hemisphere to that of mixed and right-handed individuals ( See Figure 3 in Davidson & Tremblay 2013) Subject Left-handed rMT aMT KY13 56% 46% KY8 36% 34% KY19 54% 38% Davidson, T., and F. Tremblay.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	The statement has been revised.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	We think it is important for readers to know that participants wore masks during testing because of the pandemic.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	19	7	1	Correction made.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	Results Are there differences in stimulation intensities taken from the two devices (Magstim Rapid and BiStim2)?
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	Yes, there are some differences given the difference in pulse configuration and coil output, However, rMT and aMT with the two stimulators were highly correlated at the individual level (r2=0.55).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	8	0	2	Can you report the F value and effect size?
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	We have revised the statistical analysis given the Reviewer’s comment below.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	Thanks to the Reviewer, we found out that there was a duplicate value in the dataset for MEP amplitude (hence the issue with 20 subjects in Figure 3).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	The error has been corrected and the analysis re
Author	Reviewer_2	2	20	8	1	done.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	Note that the correction did not change the results or the conclusions.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	We now report for the ANOVA’s the F value and the partial eta squared to indicate the size of the intervention.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	Would it be interesting if the present data can give the same effect size (0.71) as those reported by Chung et al. (2016)?
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	Indeed, it would be interesting.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	The size of the intervention for variations in MEP amplitude, as reflected in eta squared, is 0.19, which appears smaller than that reported by Chung et al.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	However, such an effect size could hardly be compared with the “standardized mean difference’ computed by Chung et al.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	The SMD is based on the assumption that differences in standard deviations among studies reflect differences in measurement scales and not real differences in variability among study participants (which is the case here)..
Reviewer_1	Author	1	9	0	2	In line 209, the authors reported that “Of 21 participants, 19 (13 females) completed the protocol without any issues.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	9	0	2	Two female participants had to be excluded….”.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	9	0	2	However, looking at Figure 3, it is obvious that plotted data were from 20 participants.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	9	0	2	Can the author correct this discrepancy?
Author	Reviewer_1	2	9	9	1	Please see above our reply regarding F values.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	10	0	2	Is the cut-off plus or minus 10 standard for the responder and non-responders?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	10	0	2	Looking again at Figure 3, we can observe very high variability.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	10	0	2	In my opinion, plus or minus 10% is arbitrary.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	10	10	1	We agree it does seem arbitrary but this approach has been used by many other investigators (see Hinder et al or Perellon et al) to assess neuroplastic responses to rTMS.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	10	10	1	In this respect, the ±10% cutoff provides a reasonable criterion to classify responders given the variability of responses to rTMS interventions.

Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	Why did not compare to the sham stimulation group and 50 Hz/ 5 Hz standard iTBS protocol?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	I think COVID-19 is not reason.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	Do you think 30 Hz/6 Hz TBS protocol (intermittent mode) increased MEP amplitude as compared to 50 Hz/ 5 Hz standard iTBS?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	What are the benefits of 30 Hz/6 Hz TBS protocol (intermittent mode) in comparison with 50 Hz/ 5 Hz standard iTBS?
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	1	1	We agree with the Reviewer that having a direct comparison with the 50 Hz protocol would have been ‘ideal’ but we have clearly stated the reasons as to why we did not perform such a comparison.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	1	1	First, our primary goal was to describe the effects of a modified 30 Hz iTBS protocol and not to test the relative efficacy of 30 vs 50 Hz bursts.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	1	1	Besides, as we have stated, there is already ample evidence of the effects of 50 Hz/5 Hz in the literature.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	1	1	Second, as we have explained in the limitations, our study was performed in the context of a worldwide pandemic.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	1	1	In this respect, we disagree with the reviewer.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	1	1	The pandemic has and continues to have a major impact on our research activities.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	1	1	Our lab is located in a geriatric hospital setting.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	1	1	For this reason, we had to follow very strict rules regarding who was coming on the premises and how long they would stay.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	1	1	We were allowed to recruit research participants only if they came for a short period and stayed in one room.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	1	1	A comparison between 30 and 50 Hz protocols would have meant having participants come twice (on different days), exposing them each time to risks for COVID.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	1	1	As for the benefits of the 30 Hz protocol, those are clearly stated in the discussion regarding the number of responders and the size of the facilitation.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	Does the participants have a neurological disease or other diseases?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	Please write in the manuscript.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	14	2	1	We have added a sentence to clarify that participants were screened for health conditions.

Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	The single-pulse TMS elicited 20 MEPs at baseline but at three specific time points after post-iTBS (i.e., 5-, 20- and 45-min) just elicited 15 MEPs respectively.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	Why did not also test 20, 25 or 30 MEPs?
Author	Reviewer_2	2	15	3	1	We collected more MEPS at baseline to account that variations in excitability are often larger when participants received their first series of TMS pulses (even if they have received some stimuli before collecting data to experience the sensation).
Author	Reviewer_2	2	15	3	1	Thus, 20 MEPs were deemed adequate to get a reliable estimate of resting corticomotor excitability.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	15	3	1	Along with the same reasoning, we collected 15 MEPs post iTBS since participants were now more familiar with the sensation elicited by TMS pulse and saved time.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	15	3	1	As we have explained, we had constraints imposed on us by the local REB to limit the time participants were on-site.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	15	3	1	The fact that we use 130% rMT for the test intensity also reduced inter-trial variability to provide reliable estimates of corticospinal excitability.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	In figure 1, the rMT needs to be defined.

Author	Reviewer_2	4	4	4	1	The coefficient of determination is for the regression analysis and indicates that Lat differences were significant predictors of MEP facilitation.
