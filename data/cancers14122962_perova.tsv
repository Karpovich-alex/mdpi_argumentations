					0	This manuscript adds evidence that NR2F1 is a dormancy marker.
					0	In addition, it shows that NR2F1 is primarily expressed in CAFs, particularly in inflammatory CAFs.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	Given that dormant disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) highly express NR2F1 (Fluegel et al.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	Nat Cell Biol 2017), it is puzzling how NR2F1 in CAFs of the primary tumor would contribute to dormancy of DTCs.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	It would be nice, if the authors would discuss this important point in more detail.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	The authors choose chemotherapy as a treatment option to compare it with NR2F1 levels.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	It would be interesting to see, how NR2F1 levels would change with endocrine treatment and/or endocrine resistance.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Breast cancer is a heterogenous disease.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Different subtypes behave differently in many aspects.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	It would be great to see some subtype-specific data.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	The authors state “We demonstrated that the expression of NR2F1, RARB, and TGFB1 genes are higher in previously established dormant cells (D2OR murine breast cancer cells [44] compared to the proliferative cells (D2A1 cells) in both 2D and 3D cultures (Figure 1A, all p < 0.02).” This is not true for NR2F1 in 2D.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	Please correct.
					0	The authors present interesting findings that a tumor dormancy marker, NR2F1, is predominantly expressed in the inflammatory CAFs, and high expression of NR2F1 is associated with suppressed immune response and increased density of stromal cells.
					0	However, this reviewer has a few concerns that need to be addressed before accepting this article for publication.
					0	Major:
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	This reviewer noticed that all the analysis was performed on the public data sets of bulk RNA-seq or single cell sequencing of primary breast tumors.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	Can the authors do some analyses using data generated from both primary and metastatic tumors to check if there is any difference of NR2F1 expression, and how NR2F1 expression is correlated with metastasis?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	As mentioned by the authors in Figure 3, there is no correlation between NR2F1 expression in the primary breast tumor and late recurrence.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	The authors need to analyze the single cell sequencing data and show whether the late recurrence in other organs, such as lung, bone, and brain, other than lymph node, is correlated with NR2F1 expression in the CAFs.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	Otherwise, the authors cannot make a conclusion that CAF-expressed NR2F1 regulates breast tumor dormancy.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	Moreover, the authors need to provide some, at least minimum, evidence or clues that CAF-expressed NR2F1 is responsible for tumor dormancy regulation.
					0	Minor:
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	Line 170, “Figure 1E” should be “Figure 1D”.

					0	In addition, it shows that NR2F1 is primarily expressed in CAFs, particularly in inflammatory CAFs.
					0	Response: We would like to thank reviewer #1 for his/her time and effort to review our manuscript.

					0	Comment 1: Given that dormant disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) highly express NR2F1 (Fluegel et al.
					0	Nat Cell Biol 2017), it is puzzling how NR2F1 in CAFs of the primary tumor would contribute to dormancy of DTCs.
					0	It would be nice, if the authors would discuss this important point in more detail.
					0	Response 1:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	We totally agree with the reviewer that it is puzzling how NR2F1 expressed in CAFs of the primary breast cancer contribute to the dormancy of DTCs, thus the addition of a discussion on this point in more detail will strengthen this manuscript.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Based on our results, NR2F1 expression in primary bulk tumor is associated with several pathways related to dormancy, and NR2F1 is most predominantly expressed in CAFs in the tumor microenvironment.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	However, we did not prove the underlying mechanism through which CAF-expressed NR2F1 regulates dormancy, and we do not intend to claim a causal relationship.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Single-cell sequence data of metastatic tumor cohorts will allow us to investigate whether the expression of NR2F1 in CAFs in the metastatic TME is related to the dormancy of DTCs.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	We added the following sentences to the discussion section.
					0	Discussion section (Page 13, line 427): The current study demonstrated that NR2F1 expression in the bulk tumor of primary breast cancer is associated with decreased cell proliferation and cancer stem cell-like characteristics.
					0	Previous studies mentioned that NR2F1 was highly expressed in DTCs [67].
					0	We found that NR2F1 is most predominantly expressed in CAFs in the TME of primary breast cancer.
					0	However, the findings from our study are not ample to substantiate that CAF-expressed NR2F1 regulates breast tumor dormancy.
					0	Aguirre-Ghiso group recently demonstrated that NR2F1 agonist treatment induced cancer cell dormancy [21], which raised an expectation that NR2F1 expression in primary breast cancer may have the possibility to be a biomarker.
					0	The novelty of our study is that it is CAFs, not cancer cells, that are the dominant source of NR2F1 expression in the bulk tumor.
					0	To this end, we believe that NR2F1 expression in the bulk tumor does not reflect the expression in the cancer cells, thus its value as a biomarker is in doubt.
					0	NR2F1 expression in cancer cells of primary breast cancer was not associated with cancer stem cell-like characteristics at all.
					0	In order to prove that CAF-expressed NR2F1 regulates breast tumor dormancy, one needs to analyze the single-cell sequencing data and show whether the late recurrence in other organs, such as lungs, bones, and brain, other than lymph nodes, is correlated with NR2F1 expression in the CAFs.
					0	Comment 2: The authors choose chemotherapy as a treatment option to compare it with NR2F1 levels.
					0	It would be interesting to see, how NR2F1 levels would change with endocrine treatment and/or endocrine resistance.
					0	Response 2:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	We agree with the reviewer that it would be interesting to see how NR2F1 levels would change with endocrine therapy.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	However, we do not have access to cohorts that include tumor samples before and after neoadjuvant endocrine therapy at this point.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	What we do have access to regarding endocrine therapy is a cohort comparing responders and non- responders to neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (GSE145325).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	We found that NR2F1 expression between responders and non-responders to endocrine therapy was not different.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	We added this to the results section as follows.
