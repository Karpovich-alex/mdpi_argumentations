					0	This work presented the method for multiple metal ions detection using a carbon quantum dots (CQDs) based chemosensor array by functionalization with different amino acids.
					0	Although the method of preparation of these sensors is not new, the implementation to chemosensor array is well presented.
					0	The CQDs with and without metal ions were systematically characterized (TEM, IR, XRD, XPS, etc).
					0	It is also impressive that all 11 metal ions were successfully identified by LDA with 100% classification rate.
					0	The manuscript is well written.
					0	So, I suggest to accept this paper to Molecule with only minor revision: 1.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	In page 2, you write the heading “2.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	Results”, but the content of that paragraph belong to the introduction part.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	So, please remove the heading “2.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	Results”.
					0	The manuscript is an interesting research about developing a chemosensor array for metals ions detection simultaneously.
					0	It is very well written and presented.
					0	A detailed supllementary material is very helfup and useful for readers.Here are some comments:

Author	Reviewer_2	2	4	3	1	Thank you for your valuable opinion.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	4	3	1	NAA is an abbreviation for amino acid, and we have added the description of NAA in the section of “2.3 Construction of sensor array”.
