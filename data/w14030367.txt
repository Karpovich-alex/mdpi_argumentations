In this study, the authors investigated the removal efficiency of Biological activated carbon (BAC) and biofilter coupling ultrafiltration (UF) system process for the treatment of surface water contaminated by pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs).
The study was carried out in the pilot-scale BAC-UF process with a treatment capacity of 0.16 m3/h.
After the process, the water quality was analyzed including CODMn, UV254, NH4+-N, and PPCPs.
They concluded based on the results from this study that the BAC-UF process is a promising process for producing clean drink water.
I can see very well-defined experiments and produced good results.
I also believe that this study will be useful and of interest to many readers.
Moreover, the authors present the results properly.
They also discussed their results in detail and put the difference in their results compared to the data with the literature.
However, there are some mistakes in the writing of the paper.
Please also see the attached file for my corrections/comments.
Overall, the manuscript can be accepted after the minor correction/revision to be published in the journal of Water.

Title: Pilot-scale biological activated carbon filtration-ultrafiltration (BAC-UF) system for removing pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) from surface water.
##Overall comments The authors described a pilot-scale BAC and BAC-MF technology to remove PPCPs from the river water (Foshan, Guangdong, China).
The authors have used pump water from the river to the storage tank and used supernatant water from the storage tank (Fig.
1) for this experiment.
Results have not been well discussed.
The authors reported the results with an average value and standard deviation.
However, it must need statistical analysis.
The reviewer suggests at least a t-test analysis.
Therefore, it needs a Major revision.
##Comments on the title, Abstract, and References Authors should avoid abbreviations in the title and the abstract.
Authors may revise the title to include river water instead of surface water.
References should be according to the journal format.
##Comments on Introduction section Line 44-45: Ultrafiltration (UF) as emerging technology, has been widely used to remove pollutants such as particles, colloids, bacteria and viruses, reducing the risk of water-borne diseases and …UF membranes cannot effectively rejected these soluble substances”.
Please clarify, why ultrafiltration cannot remove the PPCPs since it can remove bacteria and viruses.
##Comments on Results and discussion Please add t-test results in Table 1 for each parameter to understand the significant differences.
Authors may provide data in the supporting information file.
Why the same trend of increase or decrease in graphs (Fig.
1) was observed in Fig.
1(c).
Why is the DO concentration of BAC-effluent sometimes higher than the Raw water.
Please explain it in the manuscript.
The reviewer suggests statistical analysis using a t-test (Raw water- BAC-Effluent and Raw water – BAC/UF-effluent).
The reviewer suggests evaluating the statistical t-test for Figures 4. t-test results should be included in Table 2.
Why is the standard deviation of Erythromycin showing a high value?
Please look at the curve of BAC/UF; there was a symbol missing in near 85 days.
Please show each symbol.
The conclusion may be revised.
The authors improved significantly their manuscript, which is now ready for publication.
I recommend acceptance for publication.
Dear Authors, i reviewed again the revised version.
I would like to recommend the publication in present form.
Authors shows sincere efforts during revision.
Title: Pilot-scale biological activated carbon filtration- ultrafiltration (BAC-UF) system for removing pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) from river water.
The authors have improved the manuscript.
However, I still have some concerns.
The manuscript could be accepted for publication after a minor revision.
Comments: Authors should avoid abbreviations in the title.
Authors should add a list of abbreviations before the references.
Please avoid repeating the full name and abbreviation throughout the manuscript if you used the first-time abbreviation.
Line 46-52: & line 84-85 “Ultrafiltration (UF) as an emerging alternative technology to conventional water treatment processes, has been widely used to remove pollutants such as particles, colloids, bacteria, and viruses, thus reducing the risk of water-borne diseases [10].
Size exclusion is considered the primary removal mechanism for the UF.
However, in the case of the PPCPs with a small molecular weight (typically < 600 Da), UF membranes also cannot effectively reject these PPCPs, but nanofiltration and reverse osmosis are able to remove these PPCPs based on the thin-film composite”.
Sorry, but I don't see why UF can reject viruses and bacteria but not PPCPs.
Is it true that the molecular weight of viruses and bacteria is more than that of PPCPs?
Please elaborate.
The authors should include some information regarding the biological degradation of PPCPs by microorganisms in the introduction section.
Line 53-55: “The combined process with ultrafiltration may be another promising choice, featuring a comparable removing performance as the nanofiltration and low operational cost”.
Have the authors compared the BAC-UF performance to that of nanofiltration?
I strongly suggest that the authors explain how they performed the t-tests.
Please include the sample size (n) or degree of freedom (df).
Please show the t-value and p-value in a scientific view (e.g., 2.79E-4 would be P <.001).
Line 161-176: Please delete the name of medicinal compounds not used for this study.
Point 6: Why the same trend of increase or decrease in graphs (Fig.
1) was observed in Fig.
1(c).
Why is the DO concentration of BAC-effluent sometimes higher than the Raw water.
Please explain it in the manuscript.
The reviewer suggests statistical analysis using a t-test (Raw water- BAC-Effluent and Raw water – BAC/UF-effluent).
Response 6: Thanks very much for this comment.
The same trend (Figure 2) was mainly due to the stable removal ability of BAC and UF for organics, causing the removal restriction.
The periodic backwash (7days) of BAC caused sometimes the dissolved oxygen concentration of BAC-effluent higher than that of raw water.
After the gas scrubbing and the hydraulic backwashing, the dissolved oxygen detection of the effluent was carried out, resulting in the above results for dissolved oxygen.
Besides, the t-test was used and proved the significant difference between BAC-Effluent and BAC/UF-effluent.
Thanks for the response.
Please include it in the manuscript.
What is the utility or deterioration of PPCPs sludge after removing it from river water?
If possible, please add at least one paragraph.
Response to Reviewer 1 Comments Point 1: The innovation of this research needs to be better explored.
Response 1: The BAC biofilter can remove the PPCPs, and then the following UF can reject micro-organisms and particles flowing out from the biofilter to ensure the quality of drinking water.
The above coupling process makes up for the defects concerning respective operations of the BAC biofilter and UF.
Although many pilot-scale setups were used to treat secondary wastewater effluent for water reclamation, this type of raw water quality was different from the river water, causing the different potential of biofilm growing.
As far as we investigated, the lack of enough attention to long-term pilot study exists.
Therefore, in this study, a BAC-UF system was carried out for several months with pilot scale to access the long-term removal performances and the respective contributions of BAC and UF.
The innovation of this research has been clarified in the abstract, the introduction, and the conclusion.
Point 2: Lines 33-38: You should mention that discharge of PPCPs degrades water quality and thus it cannot be directly used for potable water and industrial applications.

Three references have been cited.
Please see lines 40-41 in the revised manuscript.
Point 3: How many replications you performed for your experiments?
Response 3: Thank you very much for your kind reminder.
These three GAC-UF systems were operated in parallel.
Samples of the feedwater and effluent from three systems were taken simultaneously and measured once.
Point 4: Conclusion: Discuss the applicability of your findings/results and future study in this field.
Response 4: Thanks very much for the reviewer.
The conclusion has been revised according to the reviewer’s suggestion.
The added paragraph in the revised manuscript is as follow: To sum up, the results show that the proposed BAC-UF system can be effective in the treatment of river water polluted by PPCPs, conventional organic pollutants and ammonia nitrogen.
The two-stage biofilms located in the activated carbon column and on the UF membrane synergistically, can be conducive to the removal performances.
Besides, the results of this analysis can have significant implications for the conventional UF operation procedure and the ozone-activated carbon process, providing a simple decentralized approach to drinking water treatment for the areas where source water is contaminated with PPCPs.
However, the mechanisms of the two-stage biofilm, such as bacterial and metazoan communities, membrane fouling and dissolved oxygen transfer, should be further investigated to enhance the removal efficiency and stability of this system.
Point 5: Conclusion: Make it as one or two paragraphs.
Response 5: Thanks for the reviewer’s suggestion.
The conclusion has been revised and integrated into two paragraphs.
The first paragraph mainly includes important findings, and the second paragraph mainly includes the outlook for the future in this field.
Point 6: Language editing is recommended.
Response 6: We are so sorry to make reviewer’s reading uncomfortable.
We have used an English Language Editing service to correct the grammatical and spelling errors and to make the expressions conform to correct scientific English (the Language Editing Certification is attached below).

However, the long-term pilot-scale study is urge to be investigated.
In this study, a 17 BAC-UF system with treatment capacity of 0.16 m3/h was operated.
The water quality was analyzed 18 including CODMn, UV254, NH4+-N and PPCPs.
The results showed that the BAC unit reduced CODMn 19 with 35.45%, while the BAC-UF further decreased to 56.00%.
The concentration of ammonia nitro- 20 gen in the raw water was closely related to the removal rate of BAC-UF on ammonia nitrogen.
Nev- 21 ertheless, BAC and UF were both related to the removal effects of NH4+-N, NO2−-N and NO3−-N. 22 Importantly, the BAC-UF process showed high efficiency in the removal PPCPs micropollutants 23 and the average removal of total PPCPs reached 47.84%, especially Anhydroerythromycin, Sul- 24 fachloropyridazine, Sulfadiazine, Trimethoprim, and Caffeine.
It was found that the BAC unit 25 played a key role in PPCPs removal and the UF unit also degraded them by the biomass on UF 26 membranes.
Therefore, this study proved the removal performance of BAC-UF for treating popular 27 pollutants from surface water.
The BAC-UF process in this work was considered feasible to produce 28 clean drinking water.

Introduction 33 Over the last few decades, the risks of pharmaceutical and personal care products 34 (PPCPs) in the aquatic environment have taken a worldwide issue in environmental con- 35 cern [1, 2].
The PPCPs catalog includes a variety of chemicals, such as human and veteri- 36 nary drugs, fragrances and disinfectants used in personal care products (e.g., soaps, lo- 37 tions, sun-screens and body cleaning products) and household chemicals [3].
These 38 PPCPs generally present in waters at trace concentrations, ranging from several ng/L to 39 thousands μg/L [4].
The concentrations and diversities complicate the associated detec- 40 tion and even create challenges for water purification processes.
Generally, many PPCPs 41 flow through conventional water treatment processes with little degradation due to their 42 persistency or/and the continuous introduction [5].

Response to Reviewer 3 Comments Point 1: The title seems good, but the abstract seems to be fine.
Please add one problem statement line in abstract to justify this sentence ``the long-term pilot-scale study is urged to be investigated.``.
Response 1: Thanks for the reviewer’s helpful suggestion.
The objective statement has been added to the abstract to support the seriousness of the problem, and the revised sentences are as follows: Biological activated carbon (BAC) biofilter coupling ultrafiltration (UF) is a promising process for the treatment of river water contaminated by pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs).
However, the pilot-scale study should be conducted to reveal the long-term removal performance and the respective contributions of BAC and UF.
Point 2: Research gap should be delivered on more clear way with directed necessity for the future research work.
Response 2: We agree with the suggestion of this reviewer.
The research gap has been added in the Conclusion and is as follow: To sum up, the results show that the proposed BAC-UF system can be effective in the treatment of river water polluted by PPCPs, conventional organic pollutants and ammonia nitrogen.
The two-stage biofilms located in the activated carbon column and on the UF membrane synergistically, can be conducive to the removal performances.
Besides, the results of this analysis can have significant implications for the conven-tional UF operation procedure and the ozone-activated carbon process, providing a simple decentralized approach to drinking water treatment for the areas where source water is contaminated with PPCPs.
However, the mechanisms of the two-stage biofilm, such as bacterial and metazoan communities, membrane fouling and dissolved oxygen transfer, should be further investigated to enhance the removal efficiency and stability of this system.
Point 3: Introduction section must be written on more quality way, i.e., more up-to-date references addressed.
Please target the specific gap such as 2015-2021 etc Response 3: Thanks for the reviewer’s comment.

Therefore, in this study, a BAC-UF system was carried out for several months with pilot scale to access the long-term removal performances and the respective contributions of BAC and UF.
The relevant content has been supplemented and revised in the abstract to highlight the innovative points.
The comparison of previous research with existing research findings was added in the final part of the results and discussion.
Point 6: What is the main challenge?
Why author choose this material?
Please highlight in the introduction part.
Response 6: Thanks very much for this comment.
Biological activated carbon (BAC) combined the adsorption and biologic degradation consuming low power energy and chemicals without concern of DBPs production as well as no frequent updates for activated carbon media.
The BAC biofilter can remove the PPCPs pollutants, and then the followed UF can reject microorganisms and particles flowing out from the biofilter to ensure the quality of drinking water.
Thus, the BAC-UF process makes up for the defects of the respective operations of BAC biofilter and UF.
Although many pilot-scale setups were used to treat secondary wastewater effluent for water reclamation, this type of raw water quality was different from the river water, causing the potential of biofilm growing differently.
As far as we investigated, the lack of enough attention to long-term pilot study is present.
Therefore, in this study, a BAC-UF system was carried out for several months with a pilot scale.
Point 7: Page 2 Line 55 need a reference.

Point 15: Please add a comparative profile section to compare your results and prove how it better than previous.
Response 15: Thanks very much for this comment.
The comparison of previous research with existing research findings was added in the final part of the results and discussion.
The added paragraph is as follows: PPCPs risks have been posing severe challenges to the safety of drinking water supply in rural areas due to the absence of the process with simple operation and maintenance as well as reliable performance.
In this study, BAC coupling gravi-ty-driven UF was performed continuously, and the rejection performance of mem-brane filtration and BAC filtration both showed barriers for the conventional pollu-tants and PPCPs.
Furthermore, this study indicated the respective contributions of BAC and UF, showing the role of the two-stage biofilm.
Previous works involving BAC generally combined the ozonation with the BAC filter for treating the contaminants of emerging concern, eliminating a majority of PPCPs by more than 90% [34].
However, the regulation and maintenance of machines for ozone products are complicated, and the disinfection by-products will be newly generated in the effluent, which is incon-venient to use in rural areas [35].
In general, coagulation, filtration and single BAC units worked inefficiently and removed the detected PPCPs by less than 50%, as they were not hydrophobic [34, 36].
Hybrid membrane processes such as inline dosing of powdered activated carbon (PAC) prior to UF have already shown promising potential for the abatement of PPCPs; however, the inline dosing PAC is infeasible in rural areas [37].
In this study, the BAC prior to UF enhanced the biological activity by forming a two-stage biofilm system.
Therefore, the integrated BAC-UF process can be considered as an economically and technically feasible approach to the decentralized and emer-gency drinking water treatment.
Point 16: Section 4 should be renamed by Conclusion and Future perspectives.
Conclusion section is missing some perspective related to the future research work, quantify main research findings, highlight relevance of the work with respect to the field aspect.
In the present form conclusion is very weird.
Response 16: Thank you very much for your kind reminder.

The references format has been corrected.
Point 4: Line 44-45: Ultrafiltration (UF) as emerging technology, has been widely used to remove pollutants such as particles, colloids, bacteria and viruses, reducing the risk of water-borne diseases and …UF membranes cannot effectively rejected these soluble substances”.
Please clarify, why ultrafiltration cannot remove the PPCPs since it can remove bacteria and viruses.
Response 4: We are very sorry for the confusion caused to the reviewers, the sentences have been revised from the words and Grammarly.
The revised sentences are shown below: Ultrafiltration (UF) as an emerging alternative technology to conventional water treatment processes, has been widely used to remove pollutants such as particles, col-loids, bacteria, and viruses, thus reducing the risk of water-borne diseases [10].
Size exclusion is considered the primary removal mechanism for the UF.
However, in the case of the PPCPs with a small molecular weight (typically < 600 Da), UF membranes also cannot effectively reject these PPCPs, but nanofiltration and reverse osmosis are able to remove these PPCPs based on the thin-film composite [11, 12].
Point 5: Please add t-test results in Table 1 for each parameter to understand the significant differences.
Authors may provide data in the supporting information file.
Response 5: Thanks very much for this comment.
The t-test results have been added in the revised Table1.

Why is the DO concentration of BAC-effluent sometimes higher than the Raw water.
Please explain it in the manuscript.
The reviewer suggests statistical analysis using a t-test (Raw water- BAC-Effluent and Raw water – BAC/UF-effluent).
Response 6: Thanks very much for this comment.
The same trend (Figure 2) was mainly due to the stable removal ability of BAC and UF for organics, causing the removal restriction.
The periodic backwash (7days) of BAC caused sometimes the dissolved oxygen concentration of BAC-effluent higher than that of raw water.
After the gas scrubbing and the hydraulic backwashing, the dissolved oxygen detection of the effluent was carried out, resulting in the above results for dissolved oxygen.
Besides, the t-test was used and proved the significant difference between BAC-Effluent and BAC/UF-effluent.
Point 7: The reviewer suggests evaluating the statistical t-test for Figures 4.
Response 7: Thank you very much for your kind reminder.
The statistical t-test was evaluated for Figure 4, which was added in the text of "3.2.

Point 8: T-test results should be included in Table 2.
Why is the standard deviation of Erythromycin showing a high value?
Response 8: Thanks very much for this comment.

Response to Reviewer 4 Comments Point 1: Authors should avoid abbreviations in the title.
Authors should add a list of abbreviations before the references.
Response 1: Thanks for the kind reminder.
We agree with this suggestion.
The abbreviations in the title have been deleted.
Besides, a list of abbreviations has been added before the references.
Point 2: Please avoid repeating the full name and abbreviation throughout the manuscript if you used the first-time abbreviation.
Response 2: Thanks to the reviewer for the patient comment.
The above mistakes have been revised.
Point 3: Line 46-52: & line 84-85 “Ultrafiltration (UF) as an emerging alternative technology to conventional water treatment processes, has been widely used to remove pollutants such as particles, colloids, bacteria, and viruses, thus reducing the risk of water-borne diseases [10].
Size exclusion is considered the primary removal mechanism for the UF.

Sorry, but I don't see why UF can reject viruses and bacteria but not PPCPs.
Is it true that the molecular weight of viruses and bacteria is more than that of PPCPs?
Please elaborate.
Response 3: Thanks to this reviewer for the comment.
Common waterborne viruses include Shigella, Vibrio cholerae, Poliovirus, adenovirus, and coxsackie virus, with sizes of 26 nm, 27 nm, 30 nm, 90 nm, and 30 nm, respectively [1-5].
The molecular weights of PPCPs are generally less than 1000 Da (about 1-2 nm), obviously smaller than the virus.
The molecular weight cut off of UF membranes was an average 100 000 Da in this work, which was similar to the virus but larger than the PPCPs molecules.

Point 4: The authors should include some information regarding the biological degradation of PPCPs by microorganisms in the introduction section.
Response 4: Thanks for the kind reminder.
The information regarding the biological degradation of PPCPs has been added in the introduction.
The revised sentences are shown below: In the BAC biofilters, the biotransformation and adsorption both contributed to the PPCPs removal.
The activated carbon adsorbed PPCPs to the surface and interior, where microorganisms were suitable for growth.
Under the long-term effect of high-concentration PPCPs, the dominant microorganisms in the biofilter were selected to survive.
These microorganisms mostly transformed PPCPs into many segments and even directly mineralized them to CO2 [3, 14].
Point 5: Line 53-55: “The combined process with ultrafiltration may be another promising choice, featuring a comparable removing performance as the nanofiltration and low operational cost”.
Have the authors compared the BAC-UF performance to that of nanofiltration?
Response 5: Thanks for the kind reminder.
“The combined process with ultrafiltration may be another promising choice, featuring a comparable removing performance as the nanofiltration and low operational cost”.
This claim is not supported by our research.
To avoid misunderstandings for readers, we changed the claim and revised the sentence.
The revised version is as follows: The combined process with UF may be another promising choice as an alternative to nanofiltration for removing PPCPs in rural areas.
It can be seen in lines 54-55.
Point 6: I strongly suggest that the authors explain how they performed the t-tests.
Please include the sample size (n) or degree of freedom (df).
Response 6: Thanks very much for this comment.
The method of the t-tests has been explained in section 2.4 (lines 157-158) in the revised manuscript.
The sample size (n) has also been added in Table 1 and Table 2.
Point 7: Please show the t-value and p-value in a scientific view (e.g., 2.79E-4 would be P <.001).
Response 7: Thank you very much for your kind reminder.
The values have been modified in the revised manuscript in yellow highlight.
Point 8: Line 161-176: Please delete the name of medicinal compounds not used for this study.

Point 9: Point 6: Why the same trend of increase or decrease in graphs (Fig.
1) was observed in Fig.
1(c).
Why is the DO concentration of BAC-effluent sometimes higher than the Raw water.
Please explain it in the manuscript.
The reviewer suggests statistical analysis using a t-test (Raw water- BAC-Effluent and Raw water – BAC/UF-effluent).
Response 6: Thanks very much for this comment.
The same trend (Figure 2) was mainly due to the stable removal ability of BAC and UF for organics, causing the removal restriction.
The periodic backwash (7days) of BAC caused sometimes the dissolved oxygen concentration of BAC-effluent higher than that of raw water.

Please see lines 180-185 in the revised manuscript.
Point 10: What is the utility or deterioration of PPCPs sludge after removing it from river water?
If possible, please add at least one paragraph.
Response 10: Thanks very much for this comment.
With a turbulent current and dozens of kilometers in length, this river is located in the mountains of Foshan city.
The PPCPs sludge at the bottom of the river never executes removal.
Thanks for the suggestion from the reviewer.
We will further precipitate the PPCPs sludge before the water treatment plant or excavate the PPCPs sludge from the river and study the effects on drinking water quality.
The relevant results will be published in another paper in the future.
