					0	Response 4:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	According to your suggestion, we have modified the Equations 4, 9 and 12 in the revised version of the manuscript as fellows.
					0	Point 5: It could be better to include base load ratings in the results section (Fig: 10) Response 5:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	According to your suggestion the baseload is added in the result section as follows: In addition, to further validate the proposed system, the appliance schedule pattern for Monday is drawn in Figure 10 and Figure 9 represents the appliance weightage given by consumers for Monday.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	In addition, Figure 8 represents the power generated graph for the same day.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	The baseload is calculated as 1000 watts for each house to keep basic appliances turn ON uninterruptedly.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	As there are 5 houses in the community the total base power for the system is 5000 watts.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	The excess power is utilize to turn ON the schedulable appliances on Monday.
					0	Point 6: Sizing of renewable energy sources and battery systems were not properly explored.
					0	Response 6:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	9	2	1	Thank you for your comment.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	As Sizing of the grid system is not the main goal of the article, but as per your suggestion, it is briefly discuss in the subsections of Mathematical modelling of the Energy sources.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	Both solar and wind systems are designed for output power equal to the consumer’s load whose annual load curve peak is maximum out of all the consumer’s in the community.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	Battery storage systems have the capability to supply uninterrupted power equal to the base load of the system up to 6 hours.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	And diesel generator equal to the rating of system’s base load is kept as a backup to avoid total black out situation.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	The designed system is not the time-varying tariff, therefore the overall system is designed to treat each consumer of the community equally.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	In time-varying tariff based system, the sizing of the system is the main objective as to accommodate the wealthy consumers of the community.
					0	Point 7: Please discuss how consumers’ comfortability is marinated in the proposed method.
					0	Response 7:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	According to your suggestion the consumer comfortability is discussed from line 144-160.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	In this work, a DSM algorithm is proposed by using renewable resources PV and wind turbines for those houses that are located far away from the main city.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	3	1	Battery storage bank is included in the system to provide the baseload power in the time when renewable sources are not suffice to meet the baseload power demand.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	3	1	Diesel generators equal to the rating of base load is kept as backup to avoid total black out in worse conditions.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	3	1	Our objective is to schedule and shift the controllable appliances by estimating hourly power generation and considering consumer demand as a variable function.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	3	1	The appliances are prioritized based on their need and demand to achieve optimum energy utilization.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	3	1	The main contribution of this paper include: A demand side management algorithm is proposed to fulfil the energy gap between generation and consumer’s demand for standalone renewable energy system.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	3	1	K-mean clustering is used to make clusters of the data based on two factors: probability of turning ON a specific appliance at time t and priority number given by consumer to that specific appliance.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	3	1	Linear integer programming is used to schedule the appliances clusters based on the available power and state of charge of the battery system.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	8	1	1	According to your suggestion, in the revised version of the manuscript, the unnecessary use of subjective pronoun is removed and overall writing of the paper is improved.
					0	Point 2: In such a study an experimental case must be presented in a specified region Response 2: Thank you for your comment.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	9	2	1	Due to the lack of real time datasets, we have used the publically available datasets for the verification of the proposed system.
