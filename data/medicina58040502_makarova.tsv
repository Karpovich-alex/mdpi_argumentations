					0	This is a well-designed and executed survey of university cigarette smoking in a country with above-average poverty.
					0	Results were consistent with previous studies of similar target populations.
					0	Recommendations did not go beyond the data and human subjects protections were adequate.
					0	Weaknesses: Two weaknesses stand out.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	First is the omission of any items referring to experience/use of eCigarette/vaping.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	Thus it is unclear if students may be nicotine addicting by alternative means to tobacco smoking.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Second it a lack of analysis of second-hand smoke exposure.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Specifically, whether exposure increases risk of smoking.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Correlations do not confirm causality.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	It is likely that students who smoke actively seek roommates who smoke, and students who do not smoke seek roommates who do not smoke.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	"Thus, exposure alone offers little information about the role of second-hand smoke and ""contagion."""
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Finally, I found it disturbing that medical school faculty tolerate student smoking at all.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	This is contrary to accepted public health policy internationally.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Healthcare providers who smoke provide a bad example to their patients - giving the impression that smoking is not dangerous.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	The link between smoking and reduced life expectancy has been shown to be causal.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	This result calls into question the university's curriculum addressing the very many diseases associated with tobacco smoking - most of which reduce life expectancy.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	This is the opposite of health promotion one expects from all healthcare providers - especially physicians.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	"The study aim should be more precise ""The aim of this study was...."""
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	Study sample - please provide more precise data on population (faculties at the university and its share in the total sample of recruited subjects)
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	Please attach an English version of the questionnaire as supplementary material or precisely describe questions that were used to assess the smoking status
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	The results section is too extensive - please avoid describing all the results in the text.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	Please provide the most important results in the text, and the rest of them are present in Tables.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	5	0	2	In table 5 please provide thr number of subjects (n=.....)
Reviewer_2	Author	1	6	0	2	Tables 6 and 7 are unclear and should be more precise (Especially confidence intervals)
Reviewer_2	Author	1	7	0	2	Please provide practical implications of this study
Reviewer_2	Author	1	8	0	2	Please provide a conclusion based on obtained findings and please avoid overwhelming conclusions
Reviewer_1	Author	3	1	0	2	Thank you for addressing all the comments.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	1	0	2	The manuscript was professionaly revised.
					0	Response to Reviewer 1 I would like to thank Reviewer 1 for very detailed and useful comments which will definitely improve our manuscript.
					0	Comment 1.
					0	Is the omission of any items referring to experience/use of eCigarette/vaping.
					0	Thus it is unclear if students may be nicotine addicting by alternative means to tobacco smoking.
					0	Response 1.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	There was a question related to electronic devices (eCigarettes) but we missed to add this data.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Only 0.5% of participants used eCigaretes or similar devices.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	We added this sentence in the section Results.
					0	Comment 2.
					0	Lack of analysis of second-hand smoke exposure.
					0	Specifically, whether exposure increases risk of smoking.
					0	Correlations do not confirm causality.
					0	It is likely that students who smoke actively seek roommates who smoke, and students who do not smoke seek roommates who do not smoke.
					0	"Thus, exposure alone offers little information about the role of second-hand smoke and ""contagion."""
					0	Response 2.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	It has been showed that higher exposure to secondhand smoking increased the risk of smoking.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that variables such as secondhand smoke at home, secondhand smoke at faculty, and secondhand smoke at public spaces can determine whether students smoke or not.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	It is also obvious that non-smokers avoid being in closed smoking places, but this was not subject of this study.
					0	Finally, I found it disturbing that medical school faculty tolerate student smoking at all.
					0	This is contrary to accepted public health policy internationally.
					0	Healthcare providers who smoke provide a bad example to their patients - giving the impression that smoking is not dangerous.
					0	The link between smoking and reduced life expectancy has been shown to be causal.
					0	This result calls into question the university's curriculum addressing the very many diseases associated with tobacco smoking - most of which reduce life expectancy.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Your comment is very logical.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Cigarette smoking, sedentary life-style and obesity are the major public health concerns, particularly in the Balkan region.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	This was a reason that we have provided some additional comments and recommendations for further actions at the very end of the Discussion section.

					0	Study sample - please provide more precise data on population (faculties at the university and its share in the total sample of recruited subjects) Response 2.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	5	2	1	To reply on this comment and to provide readers with more precise data we made some changes in two sections.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	5	2	1	In the subsection “Sample size” of the section “Materials and methods” we emphasized that “students from 16 faculties of the University of Banja Luka were participants in our study”.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	5	2	1	In section “Results” we have added a new sentence that “Majority of study participants were medical students (41.4%) and the rest were students from other faculties (58.6%).” Comment 3.
					0	Please attach an English version of the questionnaire as supplementary material or precisely describe questions that were used to assess the smoking status.
					0	Response 3.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	6	3	1	This has been already presented in Table 2. and explained by asterisks (**) below the table: * Students who smoked at least one day in 30 days prior to the survey.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	6	3	1	** Students who smoke every day and desired to smoke always or sometimes upon waking up, and where smoking time after waking up was within one day.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	6	3	1	If necessary the English version of the Questionnaire could be provided as Supplementary material.
