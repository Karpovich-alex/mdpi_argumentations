					0	This study aims to explore whether the existence of remuneration committees tend to disclose more corporate social responsibility (CSR) information.
					0	Comments are as below.
					0	Theoretical issues:
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	although the agency theory and practical function of remuneration committees were described in the manuscript, few efforts were made to give the main theoretical mechanism/logic.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	Especially since “there does not appear to be any literature focused on examining the association between the constitution of remuneration committees and the reporting of CSR information”, the authors should provide the theoretical link to propose the hypotheses.
					0	Methodological issues:
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	the dummy of CSR_index is too simple and cannot address the complexity of CSR strategy and CSR disclosure.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	And so is the independent variable.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Many other important control variables should be introduced to the regression, such as, financial performance, the firm size, the firm age, the industry-fixed effects, the country-fixed effects.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	The results may not be robust without these controls.
					0	Other issues:
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	the figure 1 can be re-designed to conform the academic norms.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	The article is methodologically OK and well written.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	However, in general, we see many articles like this in the area of social and environmental reporting.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	Also, the application of agency theory is so common that reading it over and again in the new studies also makes the readers bored these days.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	Now it is important that the new researchers try to take the research on this area to a new and interesting level.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	However, I accept this article only for the moderating variable the authors have tested.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	1	0	2	The paper studies the relationship between remuneration committees and CSR as well as the moderating role of independent directors.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	1	0	2	While the paper seems interesting I have several concerns that I would like to share with the authors: The introduction lacks of motivation.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	1	0	2	The reader needs to understand why your research question is important.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	2	0	2	The theoretical background is weak.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	2	0	2	I am not convinced on your explanation on why committees would affect CSR.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	3	0	2	Your empirical model needs to be reconsidered.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	3	0	2	Indeed, I believe you have some omitted control variables which may cause an endogeneity issue and drive your findings
Reviewer_3	Author	1	4	0	2	The paper lacks of robustness checks
					0	
Reviewer_3	Author	1	5	0	2	The conclusion needs to be rewritten to highlight the practical contributions of the paper
					0	Significant work has been done, congratulations !

Author	Reviewer_2	2	4	1	2	Thank you very much for your words.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	6	2	2	In our modest opinion, the originality of the paper is: (i) analyse of the association between remuneration committees and CSR disclosure; (ii) examine the moderating effect of independent board in the association between the remuneration committees and the disclosure of CSR information.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	6	2	2	We have not found previous research focused on these both topics.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	We have improved the section to clarify the need to extend this line of research.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Thank you for your suggestion.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	From a theoretical point of view, we find various references that explain how CSR index is calculated as the ratio between the aggregation of 140 items focused on environmental, social and economic issues and the total number of items analyzed, which codes as 1 if the firm disclose the CSR information related each item, and 0.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	4	1	1	In our modest opinion, the originality of the paper is the analysis of the moderating role played by the proportion of independent directors on boards of directors with the relationship between the constitution of remuneration committees and CSR disclosure.
