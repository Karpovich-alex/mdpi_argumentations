Author	Reviewer_1	8	2	2	1	Our responses to your comments are as follows.
					0	1)
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	In general, the manuscript refers often to PGRMC1 expression or downregulation.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	These are fuzzy terms for proteins.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	It is much preferable to refer to protein abundance, and changes in abundance.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	Such changes may occur at the translational or post-translational level.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	Translational level changes can be due to changed levels of transcription, to altered mRNA stability (such as that proposed here for miR-98), or to altered efficiency of translation of a steady state mRNA pool.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	The authors are strongly advised to change from e.g.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	‘expression’ to ‘abundance’ throughout.
					0	>>
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	We agree with your comments.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	The term ‘expression’ has, therefore, been changed to ‘abundance’ or ‘level’ throughout the manuscript.
					0	2)
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Additionally, the methods do not say that all results were repeated at least once, and that a representative results figure is presented.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Therefore, the reviewer assumes that experiments have only been performed once.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	The entire set of experiments needs to be replicated to demonstrate reproducibility before it can be considered to publish these results.
					0	>>
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	All experiments were repeated at least two times.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	We have failed the description regarding the reproducible results in the previously submitted manuscript, and so revised the section of the methods in the revised manuscript (Page 4, lins143-143).

Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Line 24.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	AG-205.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	The authors must refer to the fact that AG-205 is not specific for PGRMC1, contrary to many citations in the literature (such as would be the case here, if uncorrected).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Cite PMID: 34944026, PMID: 34680104, PMID: 32924377.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Sensitivity of a phenomenon to AG-205 is consistent with possible PGRMC1 involvement, but does not demonstrate PGRMC1 involvement.
					0	>>
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	We agree that AG-205 is not a specific inhibitor of PGRMC1.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Therefore, we examined the effects of siRNA-mediated PGRMC1 knockdown on decidualization.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	As you mentioned, this issue was not appropriately described in the previously submitted manuscript.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	The citations have been inserted in the revised manuscript (page 8, lines 258-263).
					0	4)
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	It is also suggested throughout to use “AG-205” (the correct name for the reagent: https://www.sigmaaldrich.com cat#: a1487) rather than AG205 (often incorrectly used in the literature).
					0	>>
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	The name of the reagent has been corrected to AG-205 consistently throughout the manuscript.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	Cell culture.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	What characterization was performed to confirm the identity of cells as ESCs?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	In general, there is very little detail on these primary cultured lines.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	How long are they held in culture?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	Are they stored cryogenically?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	How are they re-seeded into culture?

Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	The primary cultured ESCs we used were confirmed immunocytochemically to be positive for vimentin, a marker for stromal cells, and negative for cytokeratin, a marker for epithelial cells (please see above figure).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	ESCs at early passages (between 2 and 6 passages) were used for the experiment.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	In this study, the passaged cells were used without freezing.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	However, we have confirmed that primary ESCs can be cryopreserved in CELLBANKER, and retain characteristics such as responsiveness to decidual stimuli.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	These descriptions have been added to the revised manuscript (page 3, lines 96-99).

Reviewer_1	Author	1	13	0	2	1. inappropriately ends with “2.2.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	13	0	2	Downregulation of PGRMC1 During ESC in vitro Decidualization.” This seems to be the next section heading, in which case it should follow a line break, and say: “3.2.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	13	0	2	Downregulation of PGRMC1 During ESC in vitro Decidualization.” All subsequent section header numbers in results should be modified to accommodate the new section.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	13	13	1	Thank you for pointing this out.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	14	14	1	Based upon your suggestions, additional experiments have been performed and added individual Western blotting data from there different ESCs (named #1-3) in Figure 2.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	15	0	2	The western blot (also Fig.3) result must show the entire molecular weight range (e.g.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	15	0	2	in supplemental data), including MW markers.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	15	0	2	PGRMC1 is known to be Sumoylated or ubiquitinylated and then degraded by the proteasome pathway, which lead to higher molecular weight species (PMID: 31067491).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	15	0	2	The latter could well contribute to alterations in PGRMC1 abundance cited by this study.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	15	0	2	It is important that the involvement of the ubiquitin pathway contribution be either quantified or discarded in well controlled experiments to justify the title of the paper.
					0	>>
Author	Reviewer_1	2	15	15	1	Western blotting for PGRMC1 in figures 2, 3, and 4 have been replaced in the data with the whole molecular weight range.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	15	15	1	As you pointed out, PGRMC1 is known to be modified by sumoylation or ubiquitinylation which results in high molecular weight.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	15	15	1	The right panel shows the western blotting of PGRMC1.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	15	15	1	There are some higher molecular bands (white arrowhead) in lysates of ESCs, however, the band’s intensity was not changed by PGRMC1 siRNA treatment.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	15	15	1	Therefore, we believe that these high molecular bands detected in our experiment were non-specific bands.
					0	16)
Reviewer_1	Author	1	16	0	2	Nine PGRMC1 lysines are known to be ubiquitinated (https://www.phosphosite.org/proteinAction.action?id=5744&showAllSites=true).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	16	0	2	Individual mutation of these residues could stabilise PGRMC1 levels to reduce decidualization if miR-98 is only partially responsible for reducing PGRMC1 levels.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	16	0	2	In fact, proteasomal degradation could be much more important that miRNA reduction of the transcript in the reduction of PGRMC1 levels during decidualization.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	16	0	2	It is important to determine whether these mechanisms are both operating.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	16	0	2	At the very least this mechanism merits detailed discussion in that section.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	16	0	2	PGRMC1 protein instability could be the dominant effect involved, with miRNA transcript regulation playing only a minor part.
					0	>>
Author	Reviewer_1	2	16	16	1	As you pointed out, the possible involvement of posttranslational modification of endometrial PGRMC1 such as sumoylation and ubiquitinylation is interesting.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	16	16	1	Discussion regarding this possibility has been inserted in the revised manuscript (Page 9, lines 300-307).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	16	16	1	We will further examine whether posttranslational modification of PGRMC1 could be associated with decidualization in the next study.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	18	0	2	This cell culture experiment also seems to be based upon just one primary cell culture, split into replicates.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	18	0	2	I am uncertain because the methods do not explain how the experiment was performed.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	18	0	2	Cell culture methods must be much more clearly explained so that the reader can reconstruct each exact experiment.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	18	18	1	All data of cell culture represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments with at least repeated two times each experiment.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	19	0	2	Lines 178-9.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	19	0	2	If PGRMC1 down-regulation is critical, it should be possible to perturb decidualization by expression of an exogenous PGRMC1 protein.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	19	0	2	This could be accomplished by making an expression plasmid encoding a codon-altered PGRMC1 gene, and cotransfecting this in a controlled matrix design with siRNA.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	19	0	2	If siRNA-resistant PGRMC1 levels are able to inhibit decidualization it would provide convincing evidence in favour of the hypothesis that lowered PGRMC1 is required for decidualization, and is perhaps even a trigger.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	19	0	2	A codon-altered PGRMC1 expression vector would cost just several hundred dollars from a provider such as Genscript, so the experiment is eminently achievable.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	19	19	1	Thank you for your valuable advice to prove the significance of PGRMC1 downregulation in decidualization.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	19	19	1	Salsano et al.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	19	19	1	We will try to examine the effects of enforced expression of codon-altered PGRMC1 which is resistant for siRNA on decidualization in next study.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	21	0	2	Critically, these figures compare the effects of two variables each, and therefor one way ANOVA is not the appropriate test.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	21	0	2	Assuming binomial distribution, a two-way ANOVA is required for these experiments.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	22	0	2	Line 189-96.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	22	0	2	The paragraph describes a result showing that the results are independent of P4.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	22	0	2	However, the control structure of comparisons is incorrect.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	22	0	2	The simplest direct comparison would be db-cAMP/P4 vs. db-cAMP to permit the argument the authors are presenting.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	22	0	2	However, the effects of P4 in the absence of db-cAMP would also require control in cells without db-cAMP, +/- P4.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	22	0	2	The statistical significance of any result would be evaluated using multivariate analysis.
					0	>>
Author	Reviewer_1	2	22	22	1	As you suggested, we should have presented the data in the same graph.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	22	22	1	However, the two experiments were performed independently.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	22	22	1	Therefore, we were not able to combine the results in the graph.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	22	22	1	Because treatment with P4 alone could not induce decidualization in the experiments, we examined the effect of PGRMC1 knockdown and inhibition on db-cAMP-induced decidualization.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	22	22	1	Further study would be needed to determine whether PGRMC1 is involved in the P4 action in endometrium.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	23	0	2	Line 207: “The miRNA target prediction database, miRDB (http://www.mirdb.org), was screened to identify miRNAs with potential to interact with PGRMC1.” miR-98 is already known to regulate PGRMC1.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	30	1	1	As you mentioned, our description of ESCs isolation may be inappropriate in terms of the patients with genetical differences.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	30	1	1	ESCs were isolated from histologically normal region in the patients with leiomyoma (age 42-45).
Author	Reviewer_2	2	30	1	1	It has been reported that ESCs obtained from the eutopic endometrium of the patients with endometriosis showed impaired decidualization.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	30	1	1	Therefore, we should consider the possible influence of leiomyoma on the decidual response, but we confirmed that the isolated ESCs have differentiated into decidual cells in response to cAMP analogue and progesterone, as you pointed out.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	30	1	1	The information of the patients has been inserted in the method 2)
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	The conclusion has been verified by other 2-3 articles, and the design of this study is not rigorous enough.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	It is suggested to add cell lines or normal endometrial cells for verification.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	If further mechanism exploration is carried out, the research will be more complete and persuasive.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	31	2	1	Because of the ethical difficulties of isolating ESCs from disease-free healthy women, we routinely used ESCs isolated from the patients in surgical cases.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	31	2	1	ESC lines are commercially available (T-HESC, ATCC) and maybe useful tool to investigate the role of PGRMC1 in decidualization, as you pointed out.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	31	2	1	However, the cell lines are also established from the endometrium of leiomyoma and immortalized by transfection with hTERT.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	31	2	1	Therefore, we believe that ESCs used in this study are no different than the above cells and cell lines in examining the role of PGRMC1.In the future, we plan to use several ESCs and their cell lines to clarify the precise mechanisms of PGRMC1 downregulation and decidualization.

Author	Reviewer_2	4	9	1	1	We appreciate your review of our revised manuscript, constructive comments, and suggestions, which have helped us to improve the manuscript.
					0	Our responses to your comments are as follows.
					0	1) I requested a major revision including the use of miRNA-resistant exogenous PGRMC1 expression (altered codon usage) to demonstrate that lack of PGRMC1 attenuation will prevent decidualization.
					0	That new experimental result is what elevated the required changes to a major revision.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	2	0	2	The revised manuscript as presently resubmitted is a minor revision.
					0	This is a critical point because the very title claims that PGRMC1 downregulation is required for decidualization.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	2	0	2	This requires stronger evidence than that currently presented.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	3	0	2	Furthermore, the required experiment is technically not challenging.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	3	0	2	The authors could consider whether an inducible miRNA-resistant PGRMC1 promoter could be designed.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	3	0	2	The fact that PGRMC1 levels fall does not mean that low PGRMC1 levels are required.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	3	0	2	This may be only correlation.
					0	Before such a claim is published in the scientific literature, it must be supported by convincing evidence.
					0	Aspiration to clarify this in future papers does not merit publication of the present paper.
					0	>>
Author	Reviewer_1	4	3	3	1	As you pointed out, we infer that downregulation of PGRMC1 may be necessary for decidualization to proceed.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	3	3	1	To clarify this point, we further attempted to overexpress PGRMC1 by introducing expression vectors into primary ESCs under various conditions using lipofection and calcium phosphate transfection methods, as you suggested.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	3	3	1	Unfortunately, for reasons unknown, we were unable to establish ESCs overexpressing PGRMC1.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	3	3	1	In the present study, we found that not only knockdown of PGRMC1 but also functional inhibition with inhibitors promotes ESC decidualization in vitro.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	3	3	1	Furthermore, in a previous report, overexpression of PGRMC1 suppressed ESCs differentiation (Ref.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	3	3	1	19).
Author	Reviewer_1	4	3	3	1	These results indicate that decreased PGRMC1 in the endometrium may be associated with accelerated dedifferentiation.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	3	3	1	As you suggested, we have changed the title significantly because further evidence was not available.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	3	3	1	We plan to establish a model of miR-resistant PGRMC1 overexpression using several ESCs cell lines to investigate the role of PGRMC1 in decidualization, and if possible, we would be happy to make this our next research topic.

Author	Reviewer_1	6	3	3	1	We appreciate your review of our revised manuscript, constructive comments, and suggestions for improving the manuscript.
Author	Reviewer_1	6	3	3	1	We deeply understand the significance of the experiments using miR-98-resistant PGRMC stably expressing ESCs to directly prove the implication of the miR-mediated PGRMC1 regulation in decidualization.
Author	Reviewer_1	6	3	3	1	We are transfecting the miR-resistant PGRMC1 expression vector into ESCs cell lines to explore the role of PGRMC1 in decidualization but is not going well.
Author	Reviewer_1	6	3	3	1	As you advised, lentiviral transduction of the PGRMC1 along with fluorescent protein may enable us to effectively select the overexpressing cells without losing differentiation status in response to decidual stimuli.
Author	Reviewer_1	6	3	3	1	We have acknowledged this and suggested it as a topic for further research in the “Limitation” section of the revised manuscript following editor’s comment (page 10, lines 336-348).
Author	Reviewer_1	6	3	3	1	“Limitations: In this study, we proposed that miR-98-mediated PGRMC1 downregulation may be involved in decidualization, but were unable to examine the effects of miR-98-resistant PGRMC1 on differentiation due to technical difficulties establishing PGRMC1-overexpressing ESCs.
Author	Reviewer_1	6	3	3	1	miR-98 may not be the only miRNA that modulates PGRMC1 expression; therefore, comprehensive analysis of transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational regulation of endometrial PGRMC1 during decidualization is required.
Author	Reviewer_1	6	3	3	1	In addition, PGRMC1 can bind to various proteins, including receptors for epidermal growth factor [46] and insulin [47], cytochrome P450 [48], and serpine mRNA-binding protein 1 (SERBP1) [19].
Author	Reviewer_1	6	3	3	1	Further, PGRMC1 may interact with proteins associated with endomembrane trafficking/cytoskeleton and mitochondrial functions in decidualizing ESCs [49].
Author	Reviewer_1	6	3	3	1	Thus, we plan to investigate the modulation of endometrial PGRMC1 expression and the interaction between PGRMC1 and intracellular proteins during decidualization in the future.”

					0	demonstrate that PGRMC1 abundance levels are higher in proliferative phase versus secretory phase endometrial patient biopsies (fig.1).
					0	In primary endometrial stem cell (ESC) culture they demonstrate that chemical induction (by db-cAMP/P4) of pseudo-decidualization in culture is accompanied by decreased PGRMC1 protein levels (fig.2).
					0	In primary ESCs they argue that reduction of PGRMC1 levels by siRNA, or inhibition of PGRMC1 function by AG-205, both lead to increased abundance of decidualization markers IGFBP1 and PRL upon db-cAMP/P4-induced decidualization (Fig.3).
					0	There is some concern about the specificity of the AG-205 inhibitor here and throughout, which weakens the deductive reasoning and is discussed below.
					0	If higher PGRMC1 levels are indeed critical for the suppression of decidualization, as is reasoned by the authors, then it should be possible to maintain PGRMC1 levels artificially to inhibit decidualization, as discussed below.
					0	There is also concern about the statistical evaluation of this result, and others of same designe, as discussed below.
					0	In Fig.4 the authors argue that decidualization markers are induced by both db-cAMP and db-cAMP/P4, and that therefore P4 is not involved in the PGRMC1 response.
					0	The experiemtnal design for this conclusion is problematic, as described below.
					0	The authors go on to show that expogenous expression of miR-98 lowers PGRMC1 abundance levels (a more apt description than the fuzzy description of “PGRMC1 downregulation”, which could be by a number of mechanisms as discussed below).
					0	This paper pursues an important theme.
					0	Unfortunately, the quality of experimental design and results processing are somewhat problematic.

					0	The introduction succinctly provides background relevant for the following research description.
					0	In general, the manuscript refers often to PGRMC1 expression or downregulation.
					0	These are fuzzy terms for proteins.
					0	It is much preferable to refer to protein abundance, and changes in abundance.
					0	Such changes may occur at the translational or post-translational level.
					0	Translational level changes can be due to changed levels of transcription, to altered mRNA stability (such as that proposed here for miR-98), or to altered efficiency of translation of a steady state mRNA pool.
					0	The authors are strongly advised to change from e.g.
					0	‘expression’ to ‘abundance’ throughout.
					0	Additionally, the methods do not say that all results were repeated at least once, and that a representative results figure is presented.
					0	Therefore, the reviewer assumes that experiments have only been performed once.

					0	It is important that the involvement of the ubiquitin pathway contribution be either quantified or discarded in well controlled experiments to justify the title of the paper.
					0	Nine PGRMC1 lysines are known to be ubiquitinated (https://www.phosphosite.org/proteinAction.action?id=5744&showAllSites=true).
					0	Individual mutation of these residues could stabilise PGRMC1 levels to reduce decidualization if miR-98 is only partially responsible for reducing PGRMC1 levels.
					0	In fact, proteasomal degradation could be much more important that miRNA reduction of the transcript in the reduction of PGRMC1 levels during decidualization.

					0	Lines 178-9.
					0	If PGRMC1 down-regulation is critical, it should be possible to perturb decidualization by expression of an exogenous PGRMC1 protein.
					0	This could be accomplished by making an expression plasmid encoding a codon-altered PGRMC1 gene, and cotransfecting this in a controlled matrix design with siRNA.
					0	If siRNA-resistant PGRMC1 levels are able to inhibit decidualization it would provide convincing evidence in favour of the hypothesis that lowered PGRMC1 is required for decidualization, and is perhaps even a trigger.
					0	A codon-altered PGRMC1 expression vector would cost just several hundred dollars from a provider such as Genscript, so the experiment is eminently achievable.
					0	PGRMC1 levels are also controlled by proteolysis, mediated by the ubiquitin proteasome system as described above.
