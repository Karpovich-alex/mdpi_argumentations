Author Response
This study aims to explore whether the existence of remuneration committees tend to disclose more corporate social responsibility (CSR) information.
Comments are as below.
Theoretical issues: although the agency theory and practical function of remuneration committees were described in the manuscript, few efforts were made to give the main theoretical mechanism/logic.
Especially since “there does not appear to be any literature focused on examining the association between the constitution of remuneration committees and the reporting of CSR information”, the authors should provide the theoretical link to propose the hypotheses.
Methodological issues: the dummy of CSR_index is too simple and cannot address the complexity of CSR strategy and CSR disclosure.
And so is the independent variable.
Many other important control variables should be introduced to the regression, such as, financial performance, the firm size, the firm age, the industry-fixed effects, the country-fixed effects.
The results may not be robust without these controls.
Other issues: the figure 1 can be re-designed to conform the academic norms.
The article is methodologically OK and well written.
However, in general, we see many articles like this in the area of social and environmental reporting.
Also, the application of agency theory is so common that reading it over and again in the new studies also makes the readers bored these days.
Now it is important that the new researchers try to take the research on this area to a new and interesting level.
However, I accept this article only for the moderating variable the authors have tested.
The paper studies the relationship between remuneration committees and CSR as well as the moderating role of independent directors.
While the paper seems interesting I have several concerns that I would like to share with the authors: The introduction lacks of motivation.
The reader needs to understand why your research question is important.
The theoretical background is weak.
I am not convinced on your explanation on why committees would affect CSR.
Your empirical model needs to be reconsidered.
Indeed, I believe you have some omitted control variables which may cause an endogeneity issue and drive your findings The paper lacks of robustness checks The conclusion needs to be rewritten to highlight the practical contributions of the paper
Significant work has been done, congratulations !

Especially since “there does not appear to be any literature focused on examining the association between the constitution of remuneration committees and the reporting of CSR information”, the authors should provide the theoretical link to propose the hypotheses.
Authors: Thank you very much for your words.
In our modest opinion, the originality of the paper is: (i) analyse of the association between remuneration committees and CSR disclosure; (ii) examine the moderating effect of independent board in the association between the remuneration committees and the disclosure of CSR information.
We have not found previous research focused on these both topics.
We have improved the section to clarify the need to extend this line of research.
Methodological issues: the dummy of CSR_index is too simple and cannot address the complexity of CSR strategy and CSR disclosure.
And so is the independent variable.
Many other important control variables should be introduced to the regression, such as, financial performance, the firm size, the firm age, the industry-fixed effects, the country-fixed effects.
The results may not be robust without these controls.
Authors: Thank you for your suggestion.
From a theoretical point of view, we find various references that explain how CSR index is calculated as the ratio between the aggregation of 140 items focused on environmental, social and economic issues and the total number of items analyzed, which codes as 1 if the firm disclose the CSR information related each item, and 0.

Moreover, we include a Table 1 to justify the items used in the Corporate social responsibility disclosure.
Additionally, we have also introduced in the control variable paragraph more information to provide justifications on why those control variables are considered in this study.
We had the firm size variable labelled as LTA which is calculated as logarithm of total assets.
In this sense, we have used the control variables in line with previous research to avoid biased results.

However, I accept this article only for the moderating variable the authors have tested.
Authors: Thank you very much for your words.
In our modest opinion, the originality of the paper is the analysis of the moderating role played by the proportion of independent directors on boards of directors with the relationship between the constitution of remuneration committees and CSR disclosure.
-We have not found previous research focused on this topic using independent directors as moderator variable.
We have improved the introduction by adding a paragraph that better motivates the work.
Furthermore, we have included these other references to improve the introduction of the work: Code, U. G. G. (2006).

The paper studies the relationship between remuneration committees and CSR as well as the moderating role of independent directors.
While the paper seems interesting I have several concerns that I would like to share with the authors: The introduction lacks of motivation.
The reader needs to understand why your research question is important.
Authors: Thank you very much for this suggestion since, indeed, the introduction was presented with scant motivation.
We have corrected this issue and we have included a new paragraph based on remuneration committee and which explains the importance of including this committee for companies.
Furthermore, we have included these other references to improve the introduction of the work: Code, U. G. G. (2006).
