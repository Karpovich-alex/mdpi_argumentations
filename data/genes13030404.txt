Ren et al.
's study focus on the characterization of IbmiR319 based on its effect on plant architecture and drought response.
While congratulating the authors on this interesting study, I have the following comments.
Major comments The authors look at the expression of IbTCP11/17 (targets of miR319) from lines 418-424.
Here authors capture the early response to PEG compared to the drought response (water withdrawal) assessed earlier.
To have a meaningful comparison, the authors need to show the expression level of these two genes in the drought assay (Lines 400-417).
As the authors briefly mentioned, PEG stress is more severe than water withdrawal, so it will not give a solid verification provided there are two variables, inducer, and timing.
In our experience, we observed completely different responses when we tried to compare PEG, air drying, and water withdrawal.
This is essential given that no temporal expression baseline is established for IbTCP11/17 under water withdrawal stress and the presence of other regulatory mechanisms of IbTCP11/17.
It is interesting to see that only MDA content increases in response to drought.
The possible mechanism/reason should be included in the discussion.
The discussion needs to be further expanded.
Esp.
RNA-Seq results need to be further discussed.
There should be a summary (concluding statement at the end).
This manuscript ends very abruptly.
Minor Comments Please see the attached file.
Comments for author File: Comments.pdf
The manuscript is well written and the presented evidence supports the conclusions being made.
There are some small edits that need addressing for clarity.Pg 1 line 45: the wording "and so on" is awkward and imprecise.
Please rephrase and indicate what other processes are being referred to.Pg 2 line 67: don't assume that everyone reading the manuscript are aware of miRNA roles in plant stress physiology.
Pg 3 Plasmid and sweet potato genetic transformation section: Include relevant protocols instead of just referring to another manuscript.
Citing the original source is required but so are details needed to reproduce and evaluate the soundness of the manuscript.
The same applies to other parts of the materials and methods: Pg 6 line 239: I don't understand the point being made here.
"sequester the normal expression" is nonsensical.
Please clarify and rephrase.
The authors addressed some of the suggestions made.
However, Comments #1 (gene expression assay) and #3 (proper discussion on RNA-Seq data) aren't properly addressed.

16 Abstract: MicroRNA319 (miR319) plays a key role in plant growth, development, and multiple re- 17 sistance by repressing the expression of targeted TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PCF (TCP) 18 genes.
Two members, IbmiR319a and IbmiR319c, were discovered in the miR319 gene family in sweet 19 potato (Ipomoea batatas [L.] Lam).
Here, we focused on the biological function and potential molec- 20 ular mechanism of the response of IbmiR319a to drought stress in sweet potato.
Blocking IbmiR319a 21 in transgenic sweet potato (MIM319) resulted in a slim and tender phenotype and greater sensitivity 22 to drought stress.
Microscopic observations revealed that blocking IbmiR319a decreased the cell 23 width and increased stomatal distribution in the adaxial leaf epidermis, and also increased the in- 24 tercellular space in the leaf and petiole.
We also found that the lignin content was reduced, which 25 led to increased brittleness in MIM319.
Quantitative real-time PCR showed that the expression lev- 26 els of key genes in the lignin biosynthesis pathway were much lower in the MIM319 lines than in 27 the wild type.
Ectopic expression of IbmiR319a-targeted genes IbTCP11 and IbTCP17 in Arabidopsis 28 resulted in similar phenotypes as MIM319.
We also showed that the expression of IbTCP11 and 29 IbTCP17 was largely induced by drought stress.
Transcriptome analysis indicated that cell growth- 30 related pathways, such as plant hormonal signaling, were significantly downregulated with the 31 blocking of IbmiR319a.
Taken together, our findings suggest that IbmiR319a affects plant architecture 32 by targeting IbTCP11/17 to control the response to drought stress in sweet potato.

Introduction 36 Drought is a major environmental factor causing abiotic stress (Pearce and RS 2001, 37 Xie, Wang et al.
2017, Meng, Li et al.
2018).
Severe drought restricts crop growth and sig- 38 nificantly reduces yield worldwide (Burke, Lobell et al.
2009), (Hu and Xiong 2014).
It is 39 therefore essential that crops with drought tolerance traits are produced.
Generally, the 40 responses of plants to abiotic stress are similar, especially in the first phase—a rapid, os- 41 motic phase that inhibits shoot growth (Zhou, Li et al.
2014).
At the physiological level, 42 the symptoms of drought damage include wilting, growth retardation through reduced 43 photosynthetic capacity (especially the lost function of PSII) (Lin, Chiang et al.
2011), dis- 44 coloration, abnormal ripening, and so on (Sato, Murakami et al.
2001).

Response to Reviewer 2 Comments Point 1: Pg 1 line 45: the wording "and so on" is awkward and imprecise.
Please rephrase and indicate what other processes are being referred to.
Response 1: Thanks for your good suggestion.
We removed “and so on” in our revised manuscript.
Point 2: Pg 2 line 67: don't assume that everyone reading the manuscript are aware of miRNA roles in plant stress physiology.
Response 2: Thanks for your reminding.
We modified “As we all know” into “More and more research reveals that”.
Point 3: Pg 3 Plasmid and sweet potato genetic transformation section: Include relevant protocols instead of just referring to another manuscript.
Citing the original source is required but so are details needed to reproduce and evaluate the soundness of the manuscript.
Response 3: It is really true as you mention that the details of methods is needed.
But considering that this method is also expressed in thus way in our previous articles (Ren L, et al (2021) Genome-Wide Identification of TCP Transcription Factors Family in Sweet Potato Reveals Significant Roles of miR319-Targeted TCPs in Leaf Anatomical Morphology.
Front.
Plant Sci.
12: 686698. doi: 10.3389/fpls.2021.686698), we just cite the original source here.
Point 4: Pg 6 line 239: I don't understand the point being made here.
"sequester the normal expression" is nonsensical.
Please clarify and rephrase.
Response 4: Thanks for your question Target mimicry is a common method to study the function of miRNA.
There is a non-coding protein gene IPS in Arabidopsis, and its transcription RNA can specifically bind to miRNA through sequence complementarity, but it forms incomplete complementary bubble structure at the cleavage site of miRNA, that is, miRNA cannot cleavage IPS RNA, thus inhibiting the degradation of miRNA to its target gene mRNA.
IPS gene is equivalent to the target mimicry.
