Author Response Thank you so much dear reviewer for your positive comments regarding the revised version of our manuscript.
See file Comments for author File: Comments.pdf
The presented manuscript is related to the study of an exopolysaccharide isolated from the extremophilic microorganism Bacillus haynesii CamB6.
The authors used the RSM based on central composite design technique to maximize the EPS production by B. haynesii, and also conducted a diverse study of the EPS properties.
The studied EPS showed promising properties to use in the food industry.
In combination with a high yield of polysaccharide from the bacterial mass, this makes it attractive for practical use.
Basically, the work was done at a fairly high professional level, the material is presented clearly, well structured, the data obtained are discussed with the previously obtained literature data.
Methods are described adequately.
Major remarks To my deep regret the structural characteristic of EPS is the weak point of this publication.
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and NMR spectroscopy data can only be regarded as preliminary.
According to the 1H NMR spectrum, it can be assumed that EPS has a complex branched structure.
Probably, to establish its structure, it is necessary to use chemical methods (hydrolysis, methylation, etc.
), as well as two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy.
EPC is isolated from a thermal spring of volcanic origin, which contains a set of various elements, including heavy metals.
It is advisable, in my opinion, to provide information on the content of heavy metals in the EPS, since the authors plan to offer this product for the food industry in the future.
Minor remarks: Line 42: It is premature to include the term "structure" in keywords at this stage.
Line 526-527: The proposal should be reformulated.
According to Figure 7. the activity of the ascorbic acid is higher than the activity of EPS produced by CamB6.
The English language was improved, but there are still errors.
The following comments were not addressed correctly: Why was linkage analysis not performed?
(I was referring to the chemical method by methylation.)
Bacterial EPSs are normally composed of repeating units.
Based on the 1H NMR spectrum, the purity and/or heterogeneity of the EPS is questioned.
(I was referring to peak intensities that are not uniform.
The new spectra emphasize this even more: for example, I count at least 10 H1/H2 cross peaks of different intensities on the COSY.)
The authors added a COSY spectrum but did not analyze it.
They deleted erroneous information about mannose residues, but came up with new conclusions about mannose identity and linkages based solely on chemical shift of anomeric proton/carbon.
TOCSY and HMBC are mentioned in methods, but no results are presented.
The information contained in the other 2D spectra was not exploited to provide structural information.
Chemical shift similarity is not sufficient to identify monosaccharide and linkage in a polysaccharide repeating unit.
The evidences for the partial structure given are not convincing.
If the authors do not add methylation analysis and perform full NMR spectral analysis, the claims about structure determination should be removed from the manuscript.
The authors took into account the comments of the reviewer and significantly improved the article.

Figure 6: Bacterial EPSs are normally composed of repeating units.
Based on the 1H NMR spectrum, the purity and/or heterogeneity of the EPS is questioned.
I.
This EPS was carefully purified according to standard purification protocols for EPS.
 This is a heteropolysaccharide composed of 3 different sugars as determined for HPLC, which is highly common in this kind of polysaccharides isolated from bacterial strains (10.3390/foods11020156) II.
How can the authors ascertain that mannose does not come from mannans in yeast extract?
 There are several earlier report where different concentration of yeast extract is added to the culture media for optimized EPS production, and the resultant EPS also concisted of mannan.
However, there is no report that the mannan came from yeast extract (DOI: 10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.09.139, DOI: 10.1023/B:WIBI.0000033068.45655.2a).
The same applies for our study too.
In addition, the yeast mannan have β-(1→4) linkage and the one found in this work have α-linkage type.
This allows us to conclude they are different polysaccharides.
III.
A 2D COSY spectrum would be necessary to confirm the assignments made on the 1D: e.g., H2- Man is not normally found in the range 3.2-3.5 ppm (the statement ll.
495-496 is wrong).
 Several 2D-NMR spectra were performed to confirm 1H and 13C chemical shift of EPS structure, and their analysis was added to the manuscript.
Comment 34: The abbreviation for glucose is Glc.
Answer 34: It was corrected in manuscript Comment 35: l. 500 : The chemical shift range is more than from 1 to 5.
Answer 35: A new discussion of 1D and 2D NMR spectra was added and corrected.

Comment 42: l. 683-684: Food-grade oils are not aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons.
Answer 42: As suggested by the reviewer, the information is corrected and revised now.
Comment 43: l. 711: “to be significantly” Answer 43: Suggestion has been included in the revised version of the manuscript Comment 44: l. 725: “possibility of future” Answer 44: Suggestion has been included in the revised version of the manuscript

Answer 2: According to the composition of EPS no metal was found to be attached with the structure of purified EPS.

This is also mentioned and referred in the revised version of the manuscript.

Answer 4: Thank you so much dear reviewer for mentioning this point.
The correction has been made now in the revised version of the manuscript.

Response 2: Dear reviewer, thanks for your valuable comments for improving the quality of this paper.
We will answer in the following paragraphs because all comments were related to the same topic.
• We agree with some of the comments that you made.
However, we would like to remind you that the main purpose of this manuscript is not the complete elucidation of the EPS chemical structure but also the optimization of the EPS production, and characterization of the EPS functional properties.
At the same time, we provided different chemical properties like: sugar identification and its molar ratio, molecular weight, functional group analysis and thermal stability of the EPS, and this journal has recently published other papers with similar or less chemical information on the EPS, for instance: Kuo, H.-C.; Liu, Y.-W.; Lum, C.-C.; Hsu, K.-D.; Lin, S.-P.; Hsieh, C.-W.; Lin, H.-W.; Lu, T.-Y.

• On the other side, we performed the 1D and 2D - NMR analysis as complementary information to the other techniques in the present work.
Such analysis was performed to try to replace the traditional acid hydrolysis, methylation/acetylation and GC-MS used in glycoside analysis.
On the opposite to NMR, we do not have access to this analysis, and we could not find it as a service.
• The HPLC and NMR results from the present work confirmed the heterogeneity of the EPS (3 different sugar moieties with different molar ratios), which agrees with the other reported mannan polysaccharides.
The 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts are comparable with literature reports of other similar EPS or oligosaccharides, where complex structures are identified by NMR too (Casillo et al., 2021; Chatterjee et al; 2018).
Besides, our 2D-NMR analysis supported EPS heterogeneity, identifying different types of monomer linkages.

doi:10.1016/j.intimp.2018.04.039 • Your mention of the non-uniform peak intensity confirming the three different sugar units found.
This is because the signal intensity of NMR peaks is related to an -H abundance.
Different monomer ratios are responsible for this variation and support our findings.
Also, the 10 H1/H2 cross peaks observed in the COSY spectra supported our findings of EPS heterogeneity, given the following facts: 1) We found 3 different types of sugars by HPLC.
2) We identified by NMR at least 2 types of linkages α 1-2 Man-Man and alfa 1-4 Man-Man monosaccharides.
3) There are other 2 sugars for which the β- type of linkage was identified but not the exact sugar position.
4) Anomeric protons shifts from units at the reducing end of polysaccharide differs from the one in another position.
In conclusion, there are different linkage possibilities (plus already identified) to different monosaccharides in different ring positions.
This gives rise to a multiplicity of signals (not fully identified in this work), which could produce different H1/H2 correlations.
• About the COSY spectrum discussion, only a minor and partial discussion is presented that can be found below the Scheme in manuscript: “In the COSY spectrum, it was found its α-configuration by low-field H-1 signal at δ 5.34 and correlated with H-2 (δ 4.0), H-6 (δ 3.98 and 3.85), and H-5 (δ 4.12) (Speciale et al., 2022).” • Regarding the TOCSY and HMBC mentioned in the methods, they are now deleted from the manuscript, as suggested.
• Finally, we kindly request the reviewer to consider that this is the first approach to studying a Chilean hot spring EPS isolation and its functional characterization.
We also mention that further work to fully reveal this EPS structure will be necessary using higher resolution NMR spectra combined with chemical techniques.
This work has given partial structural elucidation, which can be considered a previous background for other research on this topic.
