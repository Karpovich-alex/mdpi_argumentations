Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	Need to update the literature review with recent studies
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	We added more coherent theoretical arguments to the discussion based on the most recently published relevant academic papers on the topic (lines 125-133, 153-158, 442-452).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	The incorporated studies include Yarram and Adapa (2021), Boukattaya and Omri (2021), Shakil (2021), Wang, Wilson & Li, (2021), Cordeiro et al 2020, Birindelli, et al.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	(2019), and Nuber & Velte (2021).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	In total, the list of references increased from 21 to 36.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	The details of these studies and the logic behind their inclusion are explained in the text (pages 3 and 4).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	For the quantitative papers, our guiding line is the inclusion of papers proposing a reliable strategy to address the problem of endogeneity characterizing virtually all studies dealing with gender diversity.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	In a nutshell, gender diversity and firms’ performances (be they financial, ESG or environmental) have reverse causality.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	More gender-diverse boards are found to improve firms’ performances, and at the same time, better performing firms are more attractive to females.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Any study incorporating these two variables would suffer from endogeneity.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Therefore, inference and results are biased.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Finding an instrument for gender diversity becomes a concern of first importance.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	The task is challenging as all potential candidates for being a suitable instrument should be already part of the regression equation.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	So far, the literature has not found an instrument unanimously agreed upon.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	This is the reason for which our selection of papers is rather limited.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	We focused on those papers with a choice of instrumental variables that are well explained and papers that ‘’go around’’ the problem by making use of a method that does not rely on external instruments.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	This includes papers using difference-GMM or system-GMM estimators.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Their principal advantage is the use of internal instruments instead of external ones.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Indeed, the instruments chosen are difference and the level of the covariates themselves.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	There are only a few of these studies available, including ours.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	This again explains the relatively restricted number of references we are considering.
					0	2-
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Please add a theoretical background section
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Initially, we opted for integrating the theoretical background disseminated throughout the text to connect to the findings of related papers and to avoid redundancy and repetition.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Changes that we incorporated in response to this comment improve the overall theoretical framework of the paper, including concepts, definitions and links to relevant literature.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	We also articulated theoretical assumptions and added a comprehensive discussion of the observed phenomena.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Specifically, we added critical mass theory discussion in the literature review section (lines 125-132).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	We added interpretation of corresponding results in the findings and discussions section (lines 445-452) and the conclusion section (lines 482-503).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	These changes in addition to the existing discussions of theories and concepts significantly improve the theoretical background of the paper.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	What are the policy implications of your study
Author	Reviewer_2	2	6	2	1	We answered this comment along different dimensions.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	6	2	1	We revise and elaborate on the explanation and interpretation of the results.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	6	2	1	We provide further explanations on the ways political and economic uncertainty shapes the relationship between corporate board gender diversity and firms’ environmental performance.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	We also emphasize the policy implications of these findings (lines 453-462, 497-503).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	To better reflect the policy implications of the study, we incorporate changes that are diffuse through the text.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	In particular, we argue that promoting gender diversity cannot deliver its full potential, and may even lead to adverse results unless it is accompanied by measures that mitigate political and economic uncertainty.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	These measures would create an enabling environment both for households and entrepreneurs.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Such measures should increase agents’ confidence, dump their willingness to invest and expand the activity by reducing their aversion to risk.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	The accompanying measures should primarily target building and strengthening institutions to unlock this potential.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Institutions are a defence against uncertainty.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	They contribute to anchoring economic agents’ expectations and stabilize the economy.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	We also elaborate on the finding of the critical mass theory.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	This result suggests that a very effective way to improve environmental quality and mitigate the adverse effects of economic activities is to encourage gender diversity in corporate boards in countries with low uncertainty where we find a higher impact on firms’ environmental performances.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	In these countries, the margin for progress is large and the effect of improving gender diversity in corporate boards materializes more easily and at lower costs, as these countries are far from their efficiency frontiers (lines 445-461 and 482-503).
					0	4- Add a discussion of results section and relate your results with theories.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	We addressed your suggestion to improve arguments and discussion of findings by revising existing and adding new paragraphs better explaining regression coefficients that demonstrate how political and economic uncertainty shapes the relationship between corporate board gender diversity and firms’ environmental performance.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	(Lines 379-389).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	Furthermore, we added supporting arguments disseminated across the text (particularly in lines 348-361, lines 379-389, etc).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	These relate our finding to theory.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	We focus here on the attitude towards risk and uncertainties.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	3	1	The related theory posits that females’ attitude when facing uncertainty is different from males.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	Women on corporate boards tend to be more risk-averse and lean more toward conservatism in uncertain environments.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	3	1	They tend to exhibit a strong inclination to wait until the uncertainty is resolved before making major business decisions.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	Therefore, the more females there are on corporate boards, the higher their weight in the board decisions would be, and by the same token, the higher the effect of uncertainty on firms’ decisions.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	Moreover, we also relate our findings to the critical mass theory, suggesting that the impact of gender diversity on the environmental performances of firms materializes only when a critical mass weight of females is realized in corporate boards (Konrad et al.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	2008, Torchia et al.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	2011, Schwartz-Ziv, 2017- page 12, lines 445-451).

					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_3	2	8	1	1	The literature on the relationship between gender diversity and environmental performances of firms that addresses dynamic endogeneity is rather limited.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	8	1	1	We mention Gaio and Gonçalves (2022), Lu and Herremans (2019), Kassini et al (2016), Silla, et al (2016) that opt for a dynamic modelling using a System-GMM estimator.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	8	1	1	This estimator is particularly suitable to panels with large number of individual and few time periods, which the case for our paper.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	8	1	1	Moreover, it accommodates situations where the independent variable changes slowly (Antoniou et al., 2008).
Author	Reviewer_3	2	8	1	1	To keep a good flow in the text, we only mention these papers in the introduction section.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	8	1	1	We elaborate further on them in the literature review section.

Author	Reviewer_3	2	12	5	1	In our initial submission, we used winsorized data for all our econometric analysis.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	12	5	1	However, we, inadvertently, displayed summary statistics (Table 2) for raw data, i.e., before winsorizing.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	12	5	1	We should have reported only winsorized summary statistics.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	12	5	1	This is precisely what we do in this revised version of the paper.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	12	5	1	The reason for winsorizing data (beyond its advantage of having regular statistical distribution) was that we initially have detected outliers.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	12	5	1	Further investigation revealed that one company (RIC: OBE.TO; CompName: Obsidian Energy Ltd) is responsible for these outliers.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	12	5	1	The company had presumably reported wrong values in FY-12, where PP&E was higher than Total Assets (see table below from Refinitiv Eikon).

Author	Reviewer_3	2	12	5	1	In order to avoid similar mistakes, we opted for winsorizing data and avoid outliers.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	12	5	1	Similarly, only one company had negative Tobins’ Q in 2017 (RIC: ELR.TO ; company name: Eastern Platinum Ltd), which was a reporting typo as well.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	12	5	1	However, our analysis is not affected by these outliers which are removed after winsorizing all the variables.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	12	5	1	In this revised version of the paper, we replace the table of summary statistics with the one based on winsorized variables.
					0	"4 6 - In line 192 you mention ""all the sectors""."
					0	But you are working one sector only, aren't you?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	6	1	The sentence “The global average of corporate boards’ gender diversity for all the sectors during 2008-2018 was about 13.5%” is correct as it is calculated based on all industries (5120 firms in total).
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	6	1	However, since we are focusing on “Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction Industry”, it makes more sense indeed to report the value for that particular sector.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	6	1	Therefore, we update the text as follows: “The average of corporate boards’ gender diversity for Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction Industry during 2008-2018 was about 9.6%”.
					0	7- Explain your sentences in lines 242-244.
					0	What did you do specifically?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_3	2	14	7	1	This is an explanation of the following sentence in our article: “To avoid bias and inconsistency that might be caused by instruments proliferation, we collapse the instruments matrix.” We are using longer lags of the dependent variable as additional instruments.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	14	7	1	Intuitively, there is a trade-off, on one hand, using longer lags gives more information and improves efficiency, but on the other hand sample gets smaller (as it is the case in standard 2SLS models).
Author	Reviewer_3	2	14	7	1	GMM is a way around this trade-off between lag length and sample length.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	14	7	1	However, implementation of System-GMM is not exempt from weaknesses.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	14	7	1	With the instruments count being quadratic in the time dimension, the variance matrix of the moments can be very large.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	14	7	1	Estimating its elements may be problematic in particular in a finite sample lacking the adequate amount of information.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	14	7	1	This finite sample bias can weaken Hansen J-test and overstate its p-value and therefore generate suspicious high pass rate of instruments validity.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	14	7	1	The problem is known as instruments proliferation (Roodman 2009).
Author	Reviewer_3	2	14	7	1	To avoid bias and inconsistency due to instruments proliferation, we limit the number of instruments used and collapse the instrument matrix which prevents the model from being over-fitted.
					0	"8- Lines 330 and onwards are presenting conclusions that are not warranted by the results and the english is a bit strange (what do you mean by ""households' anxiety""?)."
					0	Similar problems stem from the following paragraphs discussing the results.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	We revised the concerned section and rewrote the text in order to improve on clarity.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	The revised text reads as follows: Greater gender diversity for a firm located in a country with high political and economic uncertainty would lower the firm’s environmental performance (0.616-0.853=-0.237).
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	More precisely, a 1 percentage point increase in GenDiv in a country with high political and economic uncertainty 5 leads to an average decline of 0.24% in the firm’s environmental performance in the following year.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	This suggests that the previous finding on the positive relationship between more gender-diverse boards and a firms’ environmental performances tends to be conditional on reduced policy and economic uncertainty.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	More gender-diverse corporate boards would not lead to better environmental performances of firms in countries with higher uncertainty (higher WUI score).
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	The rational for this result stems from the idea that uncertainty adversely affects the enabling environment of an economy.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	This may induce financial outcomes for firms that are so negative and diffuse that they could hardly be balanced by the benefits brought with more gender- diverse boards (Bloom 2014, Atsu and Adams 2021).
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	Indeed, uncertainty hampers household confidence and makes it difficult for businesses to plan for the future.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	The lack of visibility for future economic and political prospects undermines agents’ confidence and further raises their aversion to risk.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	In terms of policy, our finding suggests that promoting gender diversity on corporate boards should be accompanied by measures that reduce political and economic uncertainty.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	This is particularly relevant for countries vulnerable to shocks whether internal or external (Covid-19, war, conflicts, trade tensions, etc.).
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	These can further exacerbate agents’ risk-aversion and deteriorate the market ability to create a sound economic and political environment in which agents interact effectively.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	In order to assess which level of the country’s uncertainty induces the negative effect of gender diversity, we introduce interaction terms with WUI quartile dummies (again, with two specifications, allowing slope and then the both slope and intercept to change).
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	The findings are summarized in Table 4 (columns 3 and 4).
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	They suggest that the interaction term with only the last quartile is statistically significant (at the 10% level), indicating that the impact of GenDiv on environmental performance is mostly driven by highly uncertain countries (those in the last quartile of the distribution).
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	Countries below the 75th percentile of the WUI do not exhibit statistically significant differences among each other.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	We investigate this finding further by examining, for different gender diversity levels, (a) the intensity of the relationship across high and low uncertainty levels and (b) the marginal impact of a country’s uncertainty status on the firm’s environmental performance (Figure 3).
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	We find that in countries with a high (above median) uncertainty level, the environmental performances of firms are significantly lower than in countries with low uncertainty, and this impact is magnified as gender diversity in corporate boards increases.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	The finding is robust for both specifications, with fixed and without fixed intercepts.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	Higher gender diversity in countries with lower uncertainty increases a firm’s environmental performance, whereas, in countries with high uncertainty, an increase in female board members has a negligible positive impact (Figure 3a) or even a negative impact (Figure 3c).
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	The gap in environmental performance between countries with high versus low uncertainty increases as gender diversity in corporate boards increases.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	A potential explanation of this finding refers to the exacerbating effects of political and economic uncertainties on entrepreneurs’ risk-aversion.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	This, in turn, discourages in-vestments in costly abatements technologies and environmental-friendly processes.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	More generally, increased risk aversion reduces investments and activities whose returns accrue more in a long-run.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	These include research and development efforts, and particularly 6 environmental-led activities, which are seen as secondary in firms’ scale of priorities.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	Ultimately, this would put pressure on firms’ behavior and worsen their environmental performances (Bloom, 20149; Atsu and Adams, 202137).
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	The arguments above provides a rationale for the worsened environmental performances of firms in response to higher uncertainties, and explains the gap in effects for firms across countries of different uncertainty levels.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	However, this does not address the potential reasons behind the widening of this gap for higher gender diversity levels.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	One potential explanation of this result relates to the particular attitude of women toward risk.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	Females on boards tend to exhibit more risk aversion compared to their male peers.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	They tend to show more patience and are typically more willing to look for professional guidance when facing uncertainty (Liu, 201838).
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	Females on boards tend to be more inclined to wait until uncertainty is resolved before making major business decisions.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	Therefore, the more females on corporate boards, the greater the weight of their decisions (i.e., the higher would be the effect of uncertainty in firms’ decisions).
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	This finding begs the question of whether the differential between countries with high versus low uncertainly levels is statistically significant for increasing gender diversity levels.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	Figure 3 (b and d) trace the magnitude of the gap between the low and high uncertainty scores.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	It states that this gap is increasing, in absolute value, and is statistically significant at the 95% level for all values of gender diversity (for gender diversity levels larger than 10%, for both specification Figures 3b and 3d).
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	This threshold value points to a standard and very important result in the literature.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	This refers to the critical mass theory, by which the impact of gender diversity on the environmental performance of firms materializes only when a critical mass weight of females is realized in corporate boards (Konrad et al., 200839; Torchia et al., 201140; Schwartz-Ziv, 201741; among others).
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	This suggests that an effective way to improve environmental quality and mitigate the adverse effects of economic activities is to encourage gender diversity in corporate boards in countries with low uncertainty where we find a higher impact on the firms’ environmental performances.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	In terms of policy, our findings suggest that promoting gender diversity cannot reach full potential, and may even lead to adverse results unless accompanied by measures that mitigate political and economic uncertainty.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	These measures would create an enabling environment both for households and entrepreneurs.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	These reduce their aversion to risk, which increases their confidence and willingness to invest.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	To unlock this potential, a country should implement accompanying measures that promote and strengthen stable institutions – as a defense against uncertainty.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	8	1	They contribute to anchoring economic agents’ expectations, and stabilize the economy.
