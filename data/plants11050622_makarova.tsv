					0	Author Response Point-by-point response to the reviewer's comments are given below The ms is the result of an intensive and years-long work of breeding, that eventually pyramidized several resistance genes and QTLs for abiotic traits into an indian elite rice variety.
					0	The work is not unprecedented in the concept, but provides interesting breeding material for specific indian farmers, which is an important achievement and is correctly taken up by authorities and international research centers.
					0	Response: Authors immensely thank reviewer for the constructive suggestions and valuable comments which greatly helped in the improvement of the manuscript.
					0	The corrections have been incorporated as per the suggestions made by the reviewer.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	The main issue with the ms is the quality of the figures: they are not clearly representing the data, arrows and text may help the reader, the controls are missing in most cases, and a general lack of precision is affecting them.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	Also, the legends are not clearly describing all the terms and should be revised.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	Legends should describe what is to be observed in the figure, possibly pointing to parts of special interest.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Figures have been revised with addition of arrows and text to represent the data.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Since a large number of ILs were screened, susceptible check (SC) was used with a set of ILs and hence SC couldn’t be shown in all figures.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	However, SC ‘HR12’ for blast disease was shown in all blast screening figures 3 to 5.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Similarly, in Fig 5, ‘TN1’ and ‘Improved Samba Mahsuri’ as susceptible and resistant checks respectively for BB in comparison with IL-19031 were shown.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Authors once again thank the reviewer for pointing out the mistake in legends.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Now, we have rephrased the legends clearly describing all the terms.
					0	Explaining briefly which and what are the Indian seasons during which experiments have been conducted would help clarity.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Figure 1 legend has been revised with inclusion of the details of kharif and rabi seasons.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	kharif is the wet season with crop growing period from June to November and rabi is the dry season with crop growing period from December to May.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	We described kharif as wet season and rabi as dry season in the materials and methods section also.
					0	The phenotypic data are important, but currently they are presented only as additional material.
					0	The authors should consider reshaping the tables, eliminating unnecessary columns (e.g.
					0	no.
					0	of genes / QTLs, which is already represented in column 1) and add the most striking phenotypic data, when possible and relevant for discussion.
					0	"Also ""entry nos."""
					0	is probably not clear and ILs no should maybe considered instead.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Since the number of ILs is large, presenting phenotypic data for each IL will result in increasing the size of the main tables, hence data was earlier presented in supplementary tables.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	As suggested by the reviewers, we have revised the tables and presented the mean phenotypic data of BB, blast and drought screening in the main tables for each IL in parenthesis.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Column on ‘no.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	of genes/QTL’ has been removed as suggested.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Entry nos have been replaced with IL No as suggested.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	The data on bgs are not sufficiently presented in the text nor discussed.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	The present work is not essentially a backcross breeding program aimed at development of near isogenic lines.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	However, Krishna Hamsa was the common background into which several genes/QTL were targeted from multiple donors and considering the morphological similarity between 27 ILs and Krishna Hamsa, background selection was done retrospectively.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	BGS validated our observations on morphological similarity.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	The same has been discussed in the 5th para under ‘discussion’.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	Also results on BGS have been presented under subsection 2.3 of results with data on polymorphic markers for BGS in supplementary table S8.
					0	Minor issues:
Reviewer_1	Author	1	5	0	2	"revise the use of ""-"" instead of ""( )"" when mentioning the numbers of the ILs, or any other system which would ensure a better homogeneity in comparison to the one present in the ms."
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	“()” have been removed while mentioned the numbers of the ILs and sentences have been revised appropriately in the manuscript.
					0	2.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	check lines 21, 37, 93, 153, 183-184, 312, 351-353, 360, 377, 466
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	The above mentioned lines have been checked and found either spelling mistakes or revision of sentences.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	Accordingly, corrections were made.
					0	3.

					0	6.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	10	0	2	lines 414 et seq.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	10	0	2	seem to be contradicting lines 351 et seq.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	10	10	1	Both lines explain our observations in different sets of ILs.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	10	10	1	Sentence at 351 explains susceptibility in ILs despite possessing the targeted gene/QTLs while sentence at 414 explains resistance in ILs despite the absence of targeted gene/QTLs.
					0	7.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	11	0	2	the 85 ILs presented at 414 seem to be a bit out of the blue: a short intro to where they are coming from would help the reader.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	11	11	1	The 85 ILs is a sum total of nine ILs marker positive to blast- R genes, nine ILs harbouring QTLs for drought tolerance and 67 ILs marker positive to BB-R genes mentioned at the beginning of 4th paragraph of discussion.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	11	11	1	As suggested, we have added in brief about the same at line 414.

Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	Thank you for inviting me to review this manuscript.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	The paper itself is well written, although 1) somewhat results are partially descriptive and partially inferential.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	However, the authors have conducted a thorough literature review, undertaken a rigorous piece of data collection, and have generalized information accurately.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	12	1	1	Authors profusely thank the reviewer for the appreciation.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	With minor grammatical revisions, the manuscript can be accepted as is.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	2	1	Yes, we agree that there were some typo and spelling mistakes in the manuscript.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	2	1	The manuscript has been thoroughly revised for the same.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	It is also acknowledged that this paper is probably the first of many papers to emerge from the study.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	As such, it is an overview paper that raises many questions.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	It would be interesting for the authors to provide more information about the research design and estimation methodologies, such as chi-square analysis of introgression lines, if possible for each crossed IL population.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	I only recommend some minor revisions before acceptance.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	Response: Authors once again thank the reviewer for correct assessment of the basic purpose of the manuscript.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	Yes, this is truly an overview paper presenting the interesting observations from our study.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	The introgression scheme and phenotyping of various biotic traits and drought phenotyping have been described in detail under ‘Materials and Methods’ section.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	The metric data on yield traits was statistically analyzed and results of ANOVA, heritability and critical differences have been presented in the manuscript.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	Authors agree that it would be more inferential with chi square values.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	However, the crossing scheme was viewed holistically and data on each cross was not maintained separately as the present study aimed at selecting introgression lines from multiples crosses with multiple stress resistance/tolerance by pooling several genes and QTLs into a common background.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	Despite maintaining large base populations, plants per se were selected based on marker positivity for inter-crossing and selfing and further stringent phenotypic selection for the targeted traits.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	Hence, chi-square which is perfectly apt for population derived from biparental crosses is not used in our study.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	This work is of outstanding quality, and I normally present more critical points in my reviews.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	However, this time it is just very beautiful work.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	14	3	1	Authors feel greatly encouraged and motivated with the reviewer’s comments.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	Line 262: “=261 %” , and Line 312 “linkes” a typo?

Reviewer_3	Author	1	13	0	2	L296-L302: the marker descriptions on main text cannot match the supplementary table S8.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	13	0	2	Also, what are those 27 ILs on L298?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_3	2	29	13	1	Table S8 represents polymorphic markers between pairs of parents including some common polymorphic markers.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	29	13	1	Hence the total number represented in the table S8 is not additive and not matching with the numbers given in the text.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	29	13	1	124 is the total polymorphic markers excluding repetition.
