					0	Very interesting and well-carried study.
					0	The experimental approach is sound.
					0	The manuscript is well-organized, all the conclusions are supported by the presented data.
					0	The paper mainly presents two key contributions: Synthesis of bioadsorbent and evaluation of its structure using SEM and FT-IR spectroscopy.
					0	Examination of prepared adsorbents for Cr(VI) ions removal.
					0	There are some points which must be edited or clarified by providing additional information or comments:
Reviewer_3	Author	1	1	0	2	The authors should write the complete terms of all abbreviations (including the instruments) before the first use in the abstract and main manuscript i.e.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	1	0	2	FT-IR and SEM in abstract section et al.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	2	0	2	The authors should clearly explain the innovation and importance of their work on the introduction of the manuscript.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	2	0	2	They should justify the value of the work and compare their work with previously similar published papers.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	3	0	2	Fig.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	3	0	2	1 - for a more effective visual comparison, authors recommended to provide SEM images of the same scale.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	3	0	2	In such form is rather difficult to make adequate comparison.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	4	0	2	EDX analysis (Fig 3) - a very conditional (not specific) type of analysis of the chemical composition of the surface.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	4	0	2	Often, spectra with different atomic abundances of elements can be obtained even from the same sample.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	4	0	2	First of all, authors have to attach a EDX mapping images before/after sorption of chromium ions.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	4	0	2	And the authors are strongly recommended to add XPS spectra to this section of revised manuscript.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	4	0	2	The XPS method is much more sensitive and more accurately determines changes in the chemical composition of samples.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	5	0	2	Why authors did not use XRD technique for sample characterization?
Reviewer_3	Author	1	6	0	2	The adsorption capacities of Al-GNSC adsorbents at different contact times have been provided.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	6	0	2	Which kinetics are right?
Reviewer_3	Author	1	6	0	2	Please add missing information about appropriate kinetic model in revised manuscript.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	7	0	2	It is rather difficult to make an adequate comparison of certain properties (catalysts or sorbents) with the already available results, since the concentration of the pollutant and the mass of the loaded sorbent vary in each experiment.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	7	0	2	Therefore, the authors are recommended to add the missing information (i.e.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	7	0	2	conditions for testing sorbents of Cr(VI) ions) to Table 3.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	8	0	2	In order to confirm proposed mechanism of Cr(VI) adsorption (illustrated on the fig 6) Authors should provide data on adsorption capacity of pristine groundnut shell activated carbon (not modified with Al).
Reviewer_3	Author	1	9	0	2	The conclusion section should be elaborated and improved.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	9	0	2	The author should bring specific conclusions in accordance with obtained results.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	The sulphuric acid disintegrated the leaves.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	Most of the substances in the leaves are reduced to carbon after two hours.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	Charring takes place by adding sulphuric acid and by the action of heat, charring removes hydrogen and oxygen from the solid, so that the remaining char is composed primarily of carbon.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	It also helps to remove the moist content in the leaves.

Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	The issue of regeneration has not been sufficiently worked out, but the authors themselves write about this, and it is not clear why NaOH was used for this.
					0	Response: We acknowledge the reviewer’s opinion.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	1	1	Based on the reviewer suggestion, regeneration studies were performed briefly.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	1	1	Four different desorption agents such as tap water, 0.1M HCl, 0.1M H2SO4 and 0.1M NaOH were utilized to remove the adsorbed chromium ions from the Al-GNSC adsorbent.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	1	1	From this various desorption agents it was identified that 0.1M NaOH was more effective.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	1	1	Hence, the reuse of Al-GNSC from Cr(VI)-loaded material was studied for sorption and desorption cycles using sodium hydroxide as a regenerated agent.
