					0	provides us with estimates of the concentrations of various proteins representing the PSII, PSI, cytb6 and Rubisco in there different cyanobacteria.
					0	The data are interesting and worth publishing but… (1)
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	I don’t understand how they calculated the protein molar ratios.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	In the methodology section we learn that they extracted the crude proteins and then performed western analyses using specific antibodies, followed by image analyses.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	I don’t understand how they converted the western data to read the amount of specific proteins, in fmol, in the various organisms as shown in Figure 2; and used for the calculations in the rest of the paper.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	(Why are the units provided again in Line 220?).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	Please provide the reader with the methodology used for the quantification.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	This immunoquantitation method used is described in detail in the reference given (Brown et al.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	2008).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	The reviewer is directed in particular to the Supplementary Methods section.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	To allow readers to get a better understanding of the method in this manuscript we have revised this part of the Experimental Section, adding extra text to increase clarity concerning the method.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	PSII activity is derived from fluorescence measurement, as ETR.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	I am missing calibration with real measurements of PSII activity such as O2 evolution.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	You have got to show it for each organism you are examining otherwise it is worthless.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	There are many reports in the literature showing dramatic decline in fluorescence but hardly any change in O2 evolution.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Since submitting the manuscript, we have accumulated a set of 84 parallel measurements of steady state oxygen evolution and the functional content of PSII measured using flash yields (with a solid state optode) and simultaneous FRR chlorophyll fluorescence induction curves, from which we can extract e- PSII-1 s-1, for both Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus cultures.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Consistent with the long literature history of such measurements (ex.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Suggett et al.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	2004, 2009), we observe a good correlation between the two measures of electron transport per PSII.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Plotting the FRR estimate of e- PSII-1 s-1 versus the O2 evolution/PSII content estimate of e- PSII-1 s-1 gives a slope of 1.26 and an R2 of 0.58.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	We have added this information to the Materials and Methods to support our use of FRR estimates of electron transport per PSII.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Furthermore, our estimates of ETRmax from FRR induction curves are independently validated by the close correlation between ETRmax and 1/tau, shown in Figure 4A, since 1/tau is derived from the rate constant for the decay of fluorescence after induction, and thus does not depend (computationally) upon our estimator for ETRmax.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	The cells were grown under a relatively low light intensity and thus the data presented here only apply to these conditions.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Please make sure the reader is aware of it.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	This has been addressed with the addition of text in the abstract, introduction and discussion specifying that the cultures were grown under low light conditions.
					0	Round 1: and Author Response The authors present a dataset where they have characterised the relative abundance of components of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain and related this to the measured rate of electron transfer from PSII.
					0	This is done for a number of globally significance marine microbes of Syn and Pro lineage.
					0	The approach and methods are robust and the ability to quantify components of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain is powerful.
					0	The data presented is robust and worthy of publication but should be discussed more critically with regard to published literature (outlined below) I suggest some minor suggestions that should be incorporated before publications.

Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	Line 19 – I am not sure why stating the cyanobacteria are nondiazatrophic is relevant?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	4	1	1	We have removed the word “nondiazotrophic” as we agree that it is not relevant to the discussion.

Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	Line 46 – (and throughout) be clear if you mean numerically dominate or dominate production – they are not always the same thing.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	5	2	1	We mean that they numerically dominate and we have clarified this in the introduction.

Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	Introduction paragraph 2 – I am unsure we know that physbobilisomes require more resource than pcb proteins – this depends on the ratio of antenna to reaction centre?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	Please include references if R3 this has been shown.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	Also, not all Pcb proteins are constitutively expressed (e.g., see Bibby et al. Nature 2003).
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	6	3	1	We have clarified this statement in the text.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	6	3	1	We refer to the nitrogen cost in the form of allocation to protein per pigment bound.

Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	Line 250 – This is estimated number of RUBISCO active sites – or is there evidence all the RUBSCIO you quantify is active?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	4	1	We are referring to the number of RUBISCO active sites measured by immunoquantitation.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	4	1	We are not referring to measured RUBISCO activity.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	4	1	We use this expression to be clear that we are referring to RbcL subunits rather than oligomeric RUBISCO.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	4	1	We have added a parenthetic phrase to make this more clear.

Reviewer_2	Author	1	5	0	2	Figure 4 – The crunch of this paper is Figure 4e which show the Rubisco:PSII ratio is correlated to ETR.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	5	0	2	While I’m convinced in the presented data only three data-points are shown – I’m most convinced in that this same relationship is presented in in “Aquatic Photosynthesis (edition 2) Figure 7.9 – Falkowski” based on work of Sukenik (1986?).
Reviewer_2	Author	1	5	0	2	A greater discussion should be given in the text to how these datasets compare and what is significantly new in this dataset?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	5	0	2	References 35 and 36 are discussed in relation to the potential control of cytb6f on limiting electron transfer from PSII but more should be made of Falkowski’s observations which support this data.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	8	5	1	We thank the reviewer for drawing this study to our attention.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	8	5	1	We have added a paragraph to the discussion to compare and contrast the Sukenik work with that presented here.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	8	5	1	The Sukenik data support a strong positive correlation between 1/tau and the RUBISCO to PSU ratio over a series of growth irradiances.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	8	5	1	While we also see a strong positive correlation between 1/tau and RUBISCO to PSII our results differ as the molar ratios of the components of the PSU differ significantly between the strains analyzed in the current work.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	8	5	1	This allows us to pinpoint the relationship of PSII to RUBISCO rather than other subunits of the PSU as the determinant of electron transport rate.

Reviewer_2	Author	1	6	0	2	Line 308 – The data presented is used to support potential cyclic electron flow around PSI – however other alternative terminal electron sinks could also be up-regulated – these concepts are discussed in a recent review by Milligan and Behrenfeld annual review 2013 – the implications of this should be discussed unless the authors can show specifically enhanced flow around PSI.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	9	6	1	We have added text to the end of the discussion to address this comment and the relevant reference has been added.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	9	6	1	Thank you for this suggestion.
					0	Second Round of Evaluation Round 2: and Author Response
Reviewer_2	Author	3	1	0	2	“In line 178 onward we read about the calibration curve.
Reviewer_2	Author	3	1	0	2	Please presnt it in the paper.
Reviewer_2	Author	3	1	0	2	Once you apply stress such as iron starvation you should recalibrate.” R4 Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	4	1	1	1	We have added a supplemental figure (Supplemental Figure #2) to show this calibrations curve.
Author	Reviewer_2	4	1	1	1	As all experiments presented here were performed under iron replete conditions, no iron starvation was performed.
Reviewer_2	Author	3	2	0	2	“Please present the calibration curves for the protein levels.” Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	4	2	2	1	We have added a supplemental figure (Supplemental Figure #1) that shows the method applied with a sample blot, calibration curve and data analysis.
Author	Reviewer_2	4	2	2	1	This work required dozens of blots, each with its own standard curve, so it would not be practical to show all of the standard curves for each determination.
