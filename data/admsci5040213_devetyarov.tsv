Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Ultimately there is then also the question of how this interaction affects performance and what policy implications the authors see (should policies be changed; should cluster initiative managers make different choices; can they if policies are given).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	The conceputal framework (figure 1) is very similar to the 'cluster initiative performance model' in the Cluster Initiative Greenbook (Solvell et al., 2003), adding the hypothesis that there might be an interaction between policy context and management and being somewhat more narrow on the elements included.

					0	R2 Round 1: Author Response to Reviewer 1 We are very grateful for your valuable comments and suggestions, which help improve our manuscript significantly.
					0	We tried to consider the comments and suggestions as far as possible in revising our manuscript.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	We fundamentally reorganized our manuscript so that its story and structure might be much clearer in the revision.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	In Section 2.2 we explicitly presented three hypotheses that are tested and discussed in later sections using information on six cluster cases.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Section 5 also was reorganized so that the relationship of local cluster management to basic conditions and to national cluster polity, respectively, could be tested for each country using some cases of clusters and cluster management.
					0	The conceptual framework (figure 1) is very similar to the 'cluster initiative performance model' in the Cluster Initiative Greenbook (Solvell et al., 2003), adding the hypothesis that there might be an interaction between policy context and management and being somewhat more narrow on the elements included.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	3	1	We revised and simplified Figure 1 by deleting cluster performance and its relationships with other factors because in fact we do not address them in our manuscript.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	We read and cited in our manuscript the suggested and other references that correspond to [25], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35] and [36] (especially in Section 2.2) in revising our conceptual framework.
					0	The language the authors use is here a bit imprecise - they seem to be talking about the management of cluster initiatives, not about the management of the policies themselves (which is more a question of how the program oversight is organized within government; also an interesting but different question).

Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	This manuscript addresses the relationship of national cluster policy and its local implementation, and not the policy organization within the government.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	Therefore, we slightly changed the titles of the manuscript and Section 5, and revised related terms throughout the manuscript, using the terms such as “local implementation” or “local management”.

					0	admsci-85306 R3 Brief Summary The paper tackles a relevant topic and takes up an important research deficit, i.e.
					0	the interface between national cluster policies and cluster management on the ground, and thus makes an original contribution to our understanding of cluster policies and their implementation.
					0	It develops a conceptual frame for the comparative analysis of cluster policies and applies it to six case studies in three countries.
					0	The paper is well-written and organised.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	However, it remains predominantly descriptive in its present state, and does not seek to explain the differences found in both countries.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	When revising the paper, the authors are advice to add a theoretical/conceptual frame that allows them to strengthen the paper’s explanatory value.
					0	In sum, I recommend that the paper be reconsidered after a major revision.
					0	The authors might find the following major and minor comments helpful when revising their paper.
					0	Broad Comments The paper fills an important research deficit by focusing on the interdependence between national cluster policy programmes and their implementation by cluster management on the ground.
					0	Its main contributions lie in the conceptual framework displayed in figure 1 and its application to six case studies from three countries.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	However, the conceptual framework appears simplistic, technocratic and static, and it is not sufficiently rooted in literature as evident from the scarcity of references in section 2.2.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	It is simplistic and technocratic because it views cluster performance as an outcome of initial conditions (i.e., the state of cluster development), cluster management and national polices.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	The paper thus rests on the untested presumption that cluster management and national policies actually impact the performance of clusters.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	As scholars, the authors should challenge this technocratic faith of policy-makers and practitioners, although evaluation is beyond this paper’s scope.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	The performance of clusters is also affected by many exogenous influences not captured in the simple model.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	5	0	2	Furthermore, ‘initial conditions’ fail to capture the complexity of clusters if they are reduced to a dichotomy of private vs. public sector dominance.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	5	0	2	Even when the industry (biotechnology) is held constant, clusters differ in a number of ways, esp.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	5	0	2	regarding their specialisation within biotechnology, their maturity, size (number of firms and employee) and firm size structure.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	6	0	2	Finally, the paper is static as it does not account for cluster evolution and (policy) learning over time.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	6	0	2	For instance, what does it mean if a regional cluster organisation is pre-dating the national policy programme it is supposed to implement, as evident from some of the cases?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	6	0	2	Such limitations do not necessarily disqualify the paper, but should be discussed reflexively in the paper’s conclusions.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	7	0	2	At present, the final section is merely a summary with the exception of the very last sentence briefly sketching the need for including evaluation in comparative cluster policy research.
					0	The paper contributes to comparative cluster policy research and thus helps overcoming the prevailing focus on individual case studies.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	8	0	2	However, it remains rather descriptive and does not systematically attempt to explain the differences found between the three countries.
					0	The authors conclude that they found ‘consistent combinations of the types of national policies, local clusters, and cluster management’.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	9	0	2	This appears hardly surprising given the co-evolution of policies and cluster management within a common institutional environment.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	9	0	2	A conceptual and/or theoretical perspective is needed to shed light at the differences found.
					0	The authors should include a discussion on how these R4 countries differ e.g.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	10	0	2	in terms of the role of the state versus private initiative, governance traditions and philosophies, centralist vs. federal set-up.
					0	As Kiese (2009) showed for three European Countries including Germany and France, these differences leave an imprint on the design and implementation of national cluster policies.
					0	The varieties of capitalism (VoC) concept developed by HALL/SOSKICE (2011) may be a suitable concept here, as it has been applied to cluster policies in the U.S. and Germany by STERNBERG ET AL. (2010).
					0	Since Japan, France and Germany are all classified as co-ordinated market economies in the original VoC concept, more nuanced differentiations of capitalisms – or other institutional frameworks – might be recommended for the paper.
					0	The authors focus on what they call ‘intellectual clusters’, a term that appears 21 times throughout the paper although I cannot recall having ever seen it in a decade or so of studying clusters and cluster policies.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	11	0	2	According to the definition on the top of page 4, the term denotes a cluster led by a public research organisation, which is rather specific and I doubt it applies to the six case studies outlined in the paper.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	11	0	2	Even so, the term ‘intellectual’ does not look fully appropriate here, which may be due to its translation from a Japanese original.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	11	0	2	‘Public research-led cluster’ might be more to the point, as it appears difficult to judge if these are more or less ‘intellectual’ than other forms of clusters.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	11	0	2	At the least, it would appear sound to qualify these six cases as science-based clusters, but then this would apply to the biotech industry and all its clusters in general.
					0	Methodology: The choice of clusters is generally well explained on pp.
					0	2-3.
					0	When elaborating on the choice of nations, one might wonder why the United States have not been included – possibly because there is no comparable national cluster policy?!
Reviewer_2	Author	1	12	0	2	When explaining the choice of regional cases, the term ‘representative’ appears misleading.
					0	It seems that the most prominent or successful cases have been selected, at least for Germany and France.
					0	How can these be ‘representative’ for whatever population of biotech clusters in these countries?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	13	0	2	When outlining their research methodology, the authors should state precisely how many interviews they conducted.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	13	0	2	It looks as if one interview was done with the cluster manager in the six regions, but the authors also claim to have interviewed ‘the presidents of cluster firms’ (p. 8, line 20) without indicating the number.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	14	0	2	Given the conceptual framework outlined in figure 1, one might also wonder why national policymakers, i.e.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	14	0	2	representatives of the respective national cluster programmes, have not been surveyed as well.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	15	0	2	Furthermore, some reflection on the adopted comparative case study research design with references would be desirable.
					0	Section 4: The presentation of the six case studies is very systematic and clear.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	16	0	2	However, sections 4.3 to 4.5 leave an impression that the assessment of these cases as ‘bottom-up’ is not completely justified.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	16	0	2	The authors seem to assume that cluster policies are either bottom-up or top-down, without any shades of grey in between.
					0	Compared to the Japanese cases, the French and German cases are clearly more bottom-up, but they still display clear – if not dominant – elements of top-down governance and public agency.
					0	This dichotomy should be refined and the classification of cases qualified as, e.g., ‘relatively bottom-up’.
					0	For the German cases, the authors may have underestimated public agency, since they did not investigate the role of state governments (Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg) within the country’s system of multilevel governance, which is key to understand cluster policies in Germany (cf.
					0	KIESE 2013).
					0	Furthermore, the state government of R5 Bavaria may be a regional government, but it is certainly not a local authority (like the city of Munich; page 15, line 29) in Germany’s system of multilevel governance.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	17	0	2	Section 5 does not include any reference and is purely descriptive and sometimes even superficial, lacking any comparison, explanation or assessment.
					0	This is probably the result of a rather weak empirical basis, provided it draws on interviews with a total of six cluster managers.
					0	Critical issues such as the cluster management organisation’s budget and finance have not been addressed.
					0	The relevance of the information presented here for the following discussion and conclusion remain far from clear.
					0	In my humble opinion, this is the weakest part of the paper that might well be omitted and replaced by a suitable conceptual frame for international comparison, as outlined above.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	18	0	2	As also elaborated above, the conclusion should go beyond a mere summary to include methodological reflection, implications for policy (learning), as well as a more extensive discussion of further research perspectives.
					0	Specific Comments
Reviewer_2	Author	1	19	0	2	Page 3, line 3: The authors might want to link to the literature on differentiated knowledge bases, which assigns an analytical (science-based) knowledge base to the biotech industry (cf.

Reviewer_2	Author	1	21	0	2	It certainly helps preventing, partly prevents, or reduces the risk of these problems occurring.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	22	0	2	Section 2 contains a number of “expectations”, which could be flagged out and numbered as hypotheses.

					0	Round 1: Author Response to Reviewer 2 We are very grateful for your detailed, insightful comments and suggestions, which help improve our manuscript significantly.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	5	2	1	We revised the concept and its explanation, and added some references in Section 2.2 and in Introduction.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	5	2	1	For more details, please see below.

					0	*
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	4	1	In this manuscript, we do not intend to demonstrate direct performance effect of cluster conditions, cluster policy, and cluster management.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	4	1	This is beyond the scope of our paper.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	4	1	It would be an important research topic to challenge the “technocratic faith”, but we cut the discussion about the factors of cluster performance from the text and Figure 1 in order to avoid any misunderstanding.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	4	1	Instead, we added a detailed discussion about “initial conditions” (now “basic conditions”) of clusters in Section 2.2 and 3.1 (a new section).
					0	• Furthermore, ‘initial conditions’ fail to capture the complexity of clusters if they are reduced to a dichotomy of private vs. public sector dominance.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	8	5	1	In page 4 below in Section 2.2, we added a brief explanation of the “initial” (now “basic”) conditions of clusters. There we suggested that they comprise various regional characteristics and that also R8 scientific or industrial focus may differ across clusters within life science or biotechnology.
					0	In the new Section 3.1, we explained the differences of basic conditions in more detail.
					0	• Finally, the paper is static as it does not account for cluster evolution and (policy) learning over time.
					0	For instance, what does it mean if a regional cluster organisation is pre-dating the national policy programme it is supposed to implement, as evident from some of the cases?
					0	Such limitations do not necessarily disqualify the paper, but should be discussed reflexively in the paper’s conclusions.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	7	1	It is true that in some cases local cluster organization had been established and had started its activity before the focal cluster policy started.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	7	1	Because of limited information, we could not sufficiently consider cluster and policy dynamics over time, but referred to the lack of dynamic approach in our study in the conclusion.
					0	• The paper contributes to comparative cluster policy research and thus helps overcoming the prevailing focus on individual case studies.

					0	Since Japan, France and Germany are all classified as co-ordinated market economies in the original VoC concept, more nuanced differentiations of capitalisms – or other institutional frameworks – might be recommended for the paper.
					0	*
Author	Reviewer_2	2	11	8	1	We recognized that we did not concretely explain the initial (we changed the term to “basic” in the revision) conditions of clusters in the previous version.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	11	8	1	Moreover, we recognize that it is important to discuss in detail how these countries differ regarding basic conditions and why the national cluster policies differ across them.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	11	8	1	Therefore, we fundamentally changed the structure of our manuscript and set up a new Section 3.1 to discuss these issues in detail.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	11	8	1	Here, we cited the suggested book chapter and paper, but mainly used statistical evidence from OECD Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard on (different) innovation systems to characterize basic conditions of clusters and to distinguish between private- and public-driven clusters.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	11	8	1	We summarized the discussion in Table 1 (new).
					0	• The authors focus on what they call ‘intellectual clusters’, a term that appears 21 times throughout the paper although I cannot recall having ever seen it in a decade or so of studying clusters and cluster policies.
					0	According to the definition on the top of page 4, the term denotes a R9 cluster led by a public research organisation, which is rather specific and I doubt it applies to the six case studies outlined in the paper.
					0	Even so, the term ‘intellectual’ does not look fully appropriate here, which may be due to its translation from a Japanese original.
					0	‘Public research-led cluster’ might be more to the point, as it appears difficult to judge if these are more or less ‘intellectual’ than other forms of clusters.
					0	At the least, it would appear sound to qualify these six cases as science-based clusters, but then this would apply to the biotech industry and all its clusters in general.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	12	11	1	Maybe “intellectual cluster” is a specific jargon in the Japanese policy.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	12	11	1	Following your suggestion, and according to the EU reports we cited in our manuscript, we deleted the adjective “intellectual” for clusters and just use “clusters”, because it does neither affect our concept nor findings.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	12	1	We did not include USA in the international comparison because, as you correctly suggested, there is no comparable national cluster policy there.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	17	15	1	With 3 references, we discussed in the (newly inserted) third paragraph of Section 2.3 the advantages of comparative case studies across countries focusing on biotechnology.
					0	R10 · Section 4: The presentation of the six case studies is very systematic and clear.
					0	However, sections 4.3 to 4.5 leave an impression that the assessment of these cases as ‘bottom-up’ is not completely justified.
					0	The authors seem to assume that cluster policies are either bottom-up or top-down, without any shades of grey in between.
					0	Compared to the Japanese cases, the French and German cases are clearly more bottom-up, but they still display clear – if not dominant – elements of top-down governance and public agency.
					0	This dichotomy should be refined and the classification of cases qualified as, e.g., ‘relatively bottom-up’.
					0	For the German cases, the authors may have underestimated public agency, since they did not investigate the role of state governments (Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg) within the country’s system of multilevel governance, which is key to understand cluster policies in Germany (cf.
					0	KIESE 2013).
					0	Furthermore, the state government of Bavaria may be a regional government, but it is certainly not a local authority (like the city of Munich; page 15, line 29) in Germany’s system of multilevel governance.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	18	16	1	The classification between top-down and bottom-up clusters is misleading.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	18	16	1	In the conceptual framework we distinguish between public-driven and private-driven clusters, so that in the revised version we focused on this type of distinction and cut all descriptions on top-down and bottom-up clusters.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	19	16	1	Referring to Kiese (2013) and Sternberg et al.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	19	16	1	(2010), but also other papers such as Crespy et al.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	19	16	1	(2007) for France, we added that, especially for Germany, we should not underestimate the roles of states and local authorities in the cluster policy.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	19	16	1	Finally, in the conclusion, we stressed the lack of multilevel governance approach as a limitation, which should be more explicitly considered in future research.
					0	• Section 5 does not include any reference and is purely descriptive and sometimes even superficial, lacking any comparison, explanation or assessment.
					0	This is probably the result of a rather weak empirical basis, provided it draws on interviews with a total of six cluster managers.
					0	Critical issues such as the cluster management organisation’s budget and finance have not been addressed.
					0	The relevance of the information presented here for the following discussion and conclusion remain far from clear.
					0	In my humble opinion, this is the weakest part of the paper that might well be omitted and replaced by a suitable conceptual frame for international comparison, as outlined above.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	20	17	1	We recognized that this section has several problems, but only this section describes and compares local cluster management based on our own interviews, so that this is the core part of our manuscript.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	20	17	1	Therefore, we fundamentally changed this section in the following way.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	20	17	1	First, we have some reference in the revised version, whereas this section is mainly based on our interviews.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	20	17	1	Second, at the beginning of this section, we explained the relevance of this section in our concept, especially with regard to our (new) hypotheses. Third, more importantly, we reorganized this section to a comparison of cluster management across three countries, focusing on the selection procedure of joint R&D R11 projects (and cutting other information such as monitoring process and support programs). In this way, we made it clear what we do in this section: to check the consistency of local cluster management (regarding project selection) with the cluster’s basic conditions and the national policy. We believe that we could clarify the relevance of the content of this section with the preceding part and the conclusion of this manuscript.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	21	17	1	Cluster Organization’s governance and financing, which was already described in another section in the previous version, is now explained even earlier, in Section 3.2.
					0	• As also elaborated above, the conclusion should go beyond a mere summary to include methodological reflection, implications for policy (learning), as well as a more extensive discussion of further research perspectives.
					0	*
Author	Reviewer_2	2	22	18	1	We cut the most part of the discussion in the conclusion (which was mostly redundant with the contents of preceding sections), and added policy implication and some limitations (lack of multilevel governance and dynamic perspectives, possible selection bias of target clusters, and the descriptive and qualitative nature of the study) combined with future research perspectives.

					0	Second Round of Evaluation Round 2:
Reviewer_1	Author	3	1	0	2	The paper now looks but I would encourage you to have a native speaker look at it, mainly to clarify the language in some places.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	2	0	2	Content-wise to me the key observation is the - potentially systematic - connection between the way cluster policies arestructure and the organization of cluster initiatives.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	2	0	2	This is not a big suprise, and it doesn't really answer the question asto which model is better (only that there are internally consistent models that are different).
Reviewer_1	Author	3	2	0	2	But it isstill a usual observation to make.
					0	Round 2: Author Response to Reviewer 1 Thank you for your comments.
Author	Reviewer_2	4	3	1	1	The revised version went through a professional, native English editing.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	2	2	1	Indeed, it is not a big surprise that the characteristics of national cluster policies and their local implementation are consistent, but still it is our (small but significant) contribution to concretely show the consistency in international comparison with original interviews of cluster managers.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	2	2	1	It is beyond the scope of our manuscript to answer the question as to which model is better for the cluster performance, so we leave it as a future research agenda.

Reviewer_2	Author	3	1	0	2	I wish to congratulate the authors for their careful and thoughtful revision.

Reviewer_2	Author	3	2	0	2	Although the new section 3.1 helps situating the cases within their respective national contexts, it’s focus is on performance indicators.
Reviewer_2	Author	3	2	0	2	If the underlying institutional differences would have been revealed as suggested, this section would be even more valuable for understanding the differences.
Reviewer_2	Author	3	2	0	2	This section now uses the term ‘innovation system’ at the national scale, but there is no discussion of or reference to the concept of national systems of innovation.
Reviewer_2	Author	3	2	0	2	A substantial body of literature has grown on the back of seminal contributions by Edquist (1997), Freeman (1987, 1988, 1995) with reference to Japan, Lundvall (1992), and Nelson (1993).

Reviewer_2	Author	3	3	0	2	Although ‘top-down’ and ‘bottom-up’ have been replaced by public-driven and ‘private-driven’, the dichotomist nature remains as the focus of my critique.

Reviewer_2	Author	3	5	0	2	P. 14: On section 4.5 in the first draft, I commented that “Unlike the regional cluster initiatives in Alsace and Baden, the trinational BioValley initiative has hardly had any impact in terms of intensifying cross-border interaction, confirming problems that Koschatzky (2000) had identified long before.
Reviewer_2	Author	3	5	0	2	Indeed, many INTERREG projects fail to overcome the differences in national languages, legislations and cultures, even though the regions are neighbours.” In response, the authors now cite this paper in footnote 14 in Section 3.2. to support the view that BioValley has hardly had any impact in terms of intensifying cross-border interaction.
Reviewer_2	Author	3	5	0	2	This reformulation is incorrect as the Koschatzky (2000) paper pre-dated the BioValley initiative and does not look at INTERREG either.
Reviewer_2	Author	3	5	0	2	Unfortunately, my claim regarding the limited impact of BioValley on cross-border networking draws on conversations with practitioners and a field trip to the region, but cannot be supported by a reference as far as I know.
Reviewer_2	Author	3	5	0	2	I would therefore suggest to drop this footnote altogether.
