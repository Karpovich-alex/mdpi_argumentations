Author Response Reviewer 2 did not have more comments on our manuscript.
I have read the manuscript entitled “Dynamics of Precipitation Anomalies in Tropical South America”.
The objective of the manuscript is to study the teleconnections and dynamics related to precipitation anomalies in Tropical South America over a longer period, using precipitation and circulation data during 1931-2016.
The data of this paper is rich and its conclusions and analysis are interesting.
However, there are still some points needed to be revised before further acceptance and publication.
LINE 18-19: It seems that “knowledge” should be conclusions?
The methods of the manuscript should be introduced in the abstract.
LINE 75-77: difficult to understand.
LINE 110: Why remove the time-mean yearly(seasonal) cycle before Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is performed on the precipitation data?
And how to remove the time-mean yearly(seasonal) cycle?
LINE 120: Please specify the range of the “10 years”, Because the period you provided on the page is 1931-2016.
And why did you choose 10 years to analyze?
LINE 163: Why choose DJF composites and PC1 to analyze VIDMF anomalies?
What is “15 g kg -1ms-1” at the bottom of figure 4?
The characters should be adjusted larger in figure 5.
LINE 270: Where did you come to the conclusion that “In the climatology, the position of the ITCZ, which coincides with the minimum value of ω, is located at 4°N”?
LINE318: Please specify the range of the “10 years”.
What’s the meaning of the “10 g kg -1ms-1” and “100 g kg -1ms-1” in figure 9?
This works presents the main large-scale atmosphric processes connected to the precipitation anomalies observed in the Tropical South America.
To pursue their goals, the authors used an observational-based gridded dataset (the GPCC Full Data Monthly Product) and the ERA-20C reanalysis dataset, as well as several teleconnections indices (related to SST anomalies).
A well-known Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been carried out to extract the leading modes of precipitation variability in the study area.
The overall judgement about this study is positive.
In my opinion, the results from this study can be of interest for the atmospheric scientists dealing with Tropical Meteorology and Climatology.
However, I think that this paper can be considered for publication on Atmosphere after the authors have fixed the following questions.
Main comments 1) In Data and Methods Section, the authors stated that they limited their study to 1931-2016 period, because before 1931 there were too few stations in the study region (mainly over Amazon).
In my opinion, more details about this point are necessary.
It is very important to assess the impact of the number of station on the realibility over the time of the considered gridded-data set.
Can you produce a simple plot showing the evolution over the time of the number of rain-gauges available for the study region?
2) About the methods.
Can you motivate the use of PCA?
Why did you not use the cluster analysis?
3) Section 3.1 (lines 149-152).
Those sentences must be motivated and supported by a quantitative investigation (for example by a correlation analysis).
See the next comment.
4) A point of weaknesses of this work is related to the absence of a coherent quantitative investigation about the relationship between the main PCs and the large-scale atmospheric features.
For example, I think that is necessary to perform at least a correlation analysis to support the association between the first PCO (considered in terms of amplitude) and the SACZ intensity, as the authors have done to support their findings about the linkages between the second PC and the ENSO.
5) Section 3.2: what happens in the negative phase of the second PC?
6) Moreover, I do not see any detailed analysis or discussion about the variability over time of the precipitation anomalies, with specific reference to the last 50 years (1970-2020), in which most of the global warming phenomenon occurred.
I suggest to add a section about this point and to investigate about (potential) changes in the relationship between large-scale features and tropical south America precipitation anomalies in the global warming era.
Minor comments 1) I suggest to standardize the citation style within the text.
According to MDPI Journal style, the reference citation numbers should be placed in square brackets, i.e.
[ ], and placed inside the punctuation.
For example, at Page 2 (line 50) I see a different citation style.
2) At the end of the introduction section, the authors should devote a couple of sentences to the structure of their manuscript.
3) Figure 2: I suggest to reverse the colorbar.
Usually, the red colors indicate positive values, whereas blue colors are related to negative values.
Please modify the colorbar and make it consisent with the other figures.
The same consideration can be applied to the Figure 8.
6) Conclusions (Pag.
11, lines 343-344): the investigated period is 1931-2016, not 1931-2010.
Finally, I suggest to carefully check the paper in order to address some minor typos.
Best regards.
I have read the manuscript entitled “Dynamics of Precipitation Anomalies in Tropical South America” again.
The objective of the manuscript is to study the teleconnections and dynamics related to precipitation anomalies in Tropical South America over a longer period, using precipitation and circulation data from 1931 to 2016.
The paper has improved a lot after the first revised version.
However, there are still some points that need to be revised before publication.
1) LINE 73: The full name of GPCC should be given when its first appearance.
2) LINE 139: What’s the meaning of the “positive phase”, which should be defined clearly.
3) LINE 190: The process description should be given more details.
4) LINE 205-207: I don't understand why you put the last sentence here?
5) LINE 216: This description is not appropriate.
The time scale of the extremes of the amplitude of the first PC is shown in Figure 5a.
6) LINE 323: Figure 3(c) is a boxplot of the normalized magnitudes of PC3 month by month, which cannot reveal that the magnitudes of PC3 are greater for the negative phase than for the positive phase.
The authors have provided convincing responses to the questions raised in the first revision round.
Therefore, I suggest to accept the manuscript for publication.
Best regards

However, there are still some points needed to be revised before further acceptance and publication.
LINE 18-19: It seems that “knowledge” should be conclusions?
R: By “knowledge” we meant state of the art literature, we have made this clearer now, we thank the reviewer for this observation.
The methods of the manuscript should be introduced in the abstract.
R: We have stated the methods used in our research in the abstract.
We thank the reviewer for this comment that has improved the content of the abstract.
LINE 75-77: difficult to understand.
R: We have rewritten this sentence; we believe it is clearer now.
LINE 110: Why remove the time-mean yearly(seasonal) cycle before Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is performed on the precipitation data?
And how to remove the time-mean yearly(seasonal) cycle?
R: The seasonal cycle was removed because our interest is to study precipitation anomalies, which are better observed once the seasonal cycle is removed.
Furthermore, when we applied the PCA analysis before removing seasonality, the first 2 PCs were related to the seasonal cycle, and they explained over 70% of variability in the data.
This obscured the variability that we aimed to analyze in our manuscript.
The seasonal cycle was removed by calculating the seasonality of rainfall for each pixel in our dataset and then removing this cycle from each pixel timeseries.
In this way, we kept values above or below average only (i.e., anomalies).
LINE 120: Please specify the range of the “10 years”, Because the period you provided on the page is 1931-2016.
And why did you choose 10 years to analyze?
R: We did not a analyze a 10-year period.
What we did was to take the 10 years with the maximum values in each PC time series and the 10 years with the minimum values in the PC time series.
We did this to build the composites that are respectively representative of the positive and negative modes of the PCs.
This is how the data for Figures 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 were selected.
LINE 163: Why choose DJF composites and PC1 to analyze VIDMF anomalies?
In section 3.1 we analyze the circulation anomalies related to PC1.
Figure 3a shows that PC1 is mainly related to the DJF season, when the SACZ is more active.
As we hypothesized that PC1 is related to the SACZ and we already found from Figure 3a that the amplitude of this PC is higher in this season, we chose to analyze the variable of interest (in this case VIDMF) for the DJF season.
What is “15 g kg -1ms-1” at the bottom of figure 4?
R: The arrow and the label 15 g kg -1ms-1 the scale for the figure.
The arrows in the figure show moisture flux in g kg -1ms-1, The arrow is the size corresponding to 15 g kg -1ms-1 The characters should be adjusted larger in figure 5.
R: We have made the font in Figure 5 bigger.
LINE 270: Where did you come to the conclusion that “In the climatology, the position of the ITCZ, which coincides with the minimum value of ω, is located at 4°N”?
R: That conclusion is from the black line in Figure 7, which shows the MAM climatology for ω.
This is now clearer in the text.
LINE318: Please specify the range of the “10 years”.
R: Please refer to our reply for the comment about LINE 120 above.
What’s the meaning of the “10 g kg -1ms-1” and “100 g kg -1ms-1” in figure 9?
R: Please refer to our reply for the comment about the 15 g kg -1ms-1 label for Figure 4.

It is very important to assess the impact of the number of stations on the reliability over the time of the considered gridded-data set.
Can you produce a simple plot showing the evolution over the time of the number of rain-gauges available for the study region?
R: We thank the reviewer for this comment that adds useful information in the present study, when we decided to limit our study period to the 1931-2016 range, we based our decision in the maps of the number of stations for each pixel in the dataset.
We have added a figure in supplementary material (Figure S1), as the figure shows, the plot for 1931 is the first one to show stations over the Andes and the central Amazon rainforest.
We believe that data prior this time (as seen on the 1921 figure and the ones before) are not sufficient for the analysis we perform.
2) About the methods.
Can you motivate the use of PCA?
Why did you not use the cluster analysis?
R: PCA is very useful tools for studying of climate.
We chose this technique as it is very adequate to distinguish among different modes of variability that are independent from each other (as each PC is calculated after the effect of the previous ones is removed), which was the objective of our analysis.
Another reason for us to choose PCA was that we needed to reduce the dimensions of our dataset, thus this method was the most suitable to fulfill of these requisites.
3) Section 3.1 (lines 149-152).
Those sentences must be motivated and supported by a quantitative investigation (for example by a correlation analysis).
See the next comment.
R: We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.
Please refer to our reply for the next comment.
4) A point of weaknesses of this work is related to the absence of a coherent quantitative investigation about the relationship between the main PCs and the large-scale atmospheric features.
For example, I think that is necessary to perform at least a correlation analysis to support the association between the first PCO (considered in terms of amplitude) and the SACZ intensity, as the authors have done to support their findings about the linkages between the second PC and the ENSO.
R: We are thankful to the reviewer for this observation that improves and strengthen the analyses of our manuscript.
In order to calculate the SACZ intensity we calculated an index based on Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) data over central-eastern Brazil delimited by 65–30◦ W, 40◦ S–0◦ N. The SACZ index is the first PC of the DJF OLR anomalies over this area.
This methodology is described in [1].
We had to calculate the correlation between PC1 and the SACZ index for the 1979-2016 period, as OLR data is only available since 1979.
When we correlated the SACZ index with our PC1 we found a correlation coefficient equal to 0.69.
Thus, we confirm that our first PC and the associated precipitation anomalies are related to the SACZ intensity.
5) Section 3.2: what happens in the negative phase of the second PC?
We have added the effects in precipitation anomalies of La Niña (or the negative phase of the second PC) to Section 3.2.
6) Moreover, I do not see any detailed analysis or discussion about the variability over time of the precipitation anomalies, with specific reference to the last 50 years (1970-2020), in which most of the global warming phenomenon occurred.
I suggest to add a section about this point and to investigate about (potential) changes in the relationship between large-scale features and tropical south America precipitation anomalies in the global warming era.
R: As observed in Figure 5, the 4 leading PCs of precipitation anomalies in Tropical South America do not have any observable trends over time.
Thus, these time series do not show a sign of the climate change in the past 50 years.
However, we do comment on the implications of our results in the context of climate change in the Conclusions section.
We refer to how the SAMS has changed, and also about how the relation between our PCs and their corresponding precipitation anomalies could be useful to infer precipitation changes should these modes of variability change in the future.
However, there is an apparent, change in the frequency and amplitude of the extremes after 1970, we have made a comment about this in the conclusions.
Minor comments 1) I suggest to standardize the citation style within the text.
According to MDPI Journal style, the reference citation numbers should be placed in square brackets, i.e.
[ ], and placed inside the punctuation.
For example, at Page 2 (line 50) I see a different citation style.
R: We thank the reviewer for this comment, we have fixed these errors of standardization in the citation style format.
2) At the end of the introduction section, the authors should devote a couple of sentences to the structure of their manuscript.
R: We thank the reviewer for this comment.
We have written a short paragraph in the end of the Introduction section.
We think this is a good addition to our manuscript.
3) Figure 2: I suggest to reverse the colorbar.
Usually, the red colors indicate positive values, whereas blue colors are related to negative values.
Please modify the colorbar and make it consisent with the other figures.
The same consideration can be applied to the Figure 8.
R: We thank the reviewer for this comment.
This is something that we considered carefully and discussed when deciding on the color bars, not only for this figure but also for the others (4 and 6).
We decided on the color bars as they are to relate blue colors to more rainfall, moisture, and thus water; and red colors to less rainfall and thus drought.
This is also stated in the figure captions.
We believe this makes for a more intuitive reading of the papers and figures.
Therefore, we would like to keep our figures in their current format.
4) Conclusions (Pag.
11, lines 343-344): the investigated period is 1931-2016, not 1931-2010.
R: We thank the reviewer for their careful revision of our paper, we have corrected this typo.
Finally, I suggest to carefully check the paper in order to address some minor typos.
R: We have checked our paper to correct the mentioned typos.

1) LINE 73: The full name of GPCC should be given when its first appearance.
R: We have implemented this change.
2) LINE 139: What’s the meaning of the “positive phase”, which should be defined clearly.
R: We thank the reviewer for this comment.
We have introduced a description of what these maps of the positive phase show in the Methods section.
Please refer to lines 128-130 in the revised version of the manuscript.
3) LINE 190: The process description should be given more details.
R: We have added a short paragraph summarizing the evidence that demonstrates that PC1 is related to the SACZ intensity.
Please refer to lines 194-197 in the revised version of the manuscript.
4) LINE 205-207: I don't understand why you put the last sentence here?
R: We thank the reviewer for this comment.
We agree that the purpose of the sentence was not clear.
We have added more details now.
The purpose is to connect it to the start of the next Section about PC2 which starts comparing the time scales of variation of PC1 and PC2 timeseries and associating this to the relevant processes (short time scale changes in SACZ intensity vs longer time scale ENSO fluctuations).
5) LINE 216: This description is not appropriate.
The time scale of the extremes of the amplitude of the first PC is shown in Figure 5a.
R: We thank the reviewer for this comment.
We have made this sentence clearer now, citing Figure 5a when referring to PC1 and Figure 5b when referring to PC2.
5) LINE 323: Figure 3(c) is a boxplot of the normalized magnitudes of PC3 month by month, which cannot reveal that the magnitudes of PC3 are greater for the negative phase than for the positive phase.
R: The normalization of our data was performed by dividing each PC time series by the maximum of the absolute value for each time series.
We did this because we wanted to keep this relevant information in our data.
Therefore, the figure reveals that the magnitudes of the negative phase of PC3 are greater than for the positive phase.
We have clarified this in the Methods section.
