Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	The authors would like to thank for this helpful comment.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	We changed the subsection as described below.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	With stating that argon-nitrogen mixtures mainly emit high amounts of radiation, the authors want to emphasize, that the sterilization efficiency is based on radiation rather than interaction of radicals with the sample.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	In low-pressure argon-nitrogen plasmas, the only significant possible radical is atomic nitrogen.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	As atomic nitrogen is not known for high etching efficiency towards organic materials, the main reason for inactivation of D. radiodurans is based on radiation effects.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Furthermore, Argon-Nitrogen plasmas emit high amounts of radiation compared to Argon-Oxygen plasmas, as shown for example in [5].
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	The data in [5] is not comparable in absolute values, as the system was changed afterwards.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Absolutely calibrated spectra were measured and have been submitted in another publication.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	The authors think that estimating the inactivation efficiency towards D. radiodurans based on the UV dose cannot be performed on a reliable bases due to the following reasons: First, the inactivation efficiency towards spores is not only depending on the overall dose of the emitted radiation, but especially on the dose per wavelength.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	This has been demonstrated by Munakata et al.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	for B. subtilis spores (Munakata et al., Photochemistry and Photobiology, Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 1991, 54, 761-768).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	To the authors’ knowledge, there is no publication measuring the wavelength depending inactivation efficiency of B. radiodurans in the VUV.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Second, the samples are mixed with Mars Analog Soil and most of the samples are covered with it.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	This leads to a very inhomogeneous exposure of the samples which can only be estimated arbitrarily.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	To address the reviewer’s comments, subsection 2.3 has been modified as follows: An argon-nitrogen mixture (100:5 sccm) was used with continuous power of 500 W, as it emits significantly higher amounts of radiation in the bactericidal wavelength region from 100 nm to 400 nm compared to an argon-oxygen mixture (100:5 sccm) [5].
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	The absolute values presented in [5] are not applicable to the results shown here, due to modification of the plasma system concerning the power coupling.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Nevertheless, the significantly higher emission of the argon-nitrogen mixture is shown.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Absolute values of the radiation dose in the range from 100 nm to 400 nm of the system configuration used in this study were measured and submitted [6].
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	A possible radical that can interact with the samples is atomic nitrogen.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	As atomic nitrogen is not known for etching of organic materials, we assume that inactivation in the argon-nitrogen mixture is based on radiation effects.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Submitted to Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	The other potentially inactivating components of the plasma are not specified in the manuscript.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	For the argon-oxygen gas mixture it is stated that ‘high amounts of reactive oxygen species are formed in the plasma’ again without any qualitative and quantitative description.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Estimations of the average free length of path for the inactivating plasma components might have been helpful for experiment planning.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	The authors thank the referee for this comment that demonstrates that the authors need to clarify.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	However, to the authors it is not clear which potentially inactivating components of the plasma are not specified, as radicals and radiation are mentioned and the temperature is kept below 80°C to prevent inactivation effects due to heating.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	As the samples are placed in an ICP discharge, ions towards the samples are only accelerated by several tenth of eV.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Thus, sputtering of the sample due to ion bombardment can be neglected.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Low-pressure plasmas dissociate molecular gases up to several percent.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Thus, the authors wanted to emphasize, that the atomic oxygen density and therewith the atomic oxygen flux to the samples is in the order of a few percent of the overall gas flux.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Quantitative and even qualitative analysis of atomic oxygen densities by optical emission spectroscopy is not an easy task as several parameters like gas temperature, electron density and electron temperature are necessary.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	This is even more challenging in pulsed mode, as the plasma does not achieve a steady state due to switching it on and off to prevent intensive heating of the plasma.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Determination of the gas densities and plasma parameters is currently addressed in extensive analysis of plasmas with different gas compositions but not finished and published yet.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Nevertheless, the authors’ state, that a relevant amount of atomic oxygen species is produced in the low pressure argon-oxygen plasma as the minimum energy for dissociation of molecular oxygen is around 5 eV.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	The ionization energy for argon is 16 eV and 13 eV for molecular oxygen.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Thus, sufficient electrons with enough energy to dissociate molecular oxygen will be present in the plasma for dissociation up to a few percent.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	In the authors’ view, estimating the mean free path of the atomic oxygen in the plasma is not necessary, as recombination of radicals in low pressure plasmas in the regime of a few Pascal takes place at the surfaces.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Thus, any radical formed will be lost at the walls and not on its way to a surface.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Estimating the mean free path of the radical in the Mars Analog Soil can only be performed on an arbitrary basis as the sticking and recombination coefficients of atomic oxygen are not known for the Mars Analog Soil.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Thus, any calculation of the mean free path of the radical is based on estimated data and could only be verified by experiments.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	To address the reviewer’s comments, subsection 2.3 has been modified as follows: Only JSC Mars-1A analog soil was used in the second trial.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	In this case, an argon-oxygen mixture (100:5 sccm) was used as it produces reactive oxygen species due to dissociation of molecular oxygen in the plasma.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Since radiation-based sterilization is faster than sterilization due to oxidation, the treatment time was increased.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	As this leads to heating of the sample above 80 °C in the continuous plasma, we used a pulsed mode, switching the plasma on and off at a frequency of 1 kHz and a duty cycle of 10 %.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	To account for this fact, the treatment time was increased to 45 min, yielding a plasma exposure time of 4.5 min.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Furthermore, the power was increased to 1500 W, yielding a mean power of 150 W, as it is only applied 10 % of the time.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	The plasma conditions are not matched to each other as the main objective was to observe to what degree the cells of D. radiodurans were affected by radiation or reactive species and not which component is more efficient.
					0	As the samples are placed in an ICP discharge, ions towards the samples are only accelerated by several tenth of eV.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Thus, sputtering of the sample due to ion bombardment can be neglected as possible inactivation mechanism.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Three different Mars regolith simulants were used.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	The mineralogical composition is given in table, but not the grain size distribution.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Knowing the grain sizes and assuming a homogeneous distributrion of cells and grains or a measurement of the real distribution an assessment can be made about the shading effect of the grains with respect to UV radiation.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	The authors should have estimated the maximal theoretically achievable effect and to plan the experiments accordingly.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	The grain size distributions of the three Mars regolith simulants have been added to the text in form of two additional tables (table 2: P-MRS and S-MRS; and table 3: JSC Mars-1A), as well as a new citation for the grain size distribution of JSC Mars-1A [8].
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	To assess the shading effect of the regolith is difficult.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	As described we used a very thin layer of regolith particles, but did not measure them according to their shading effect but according to the weight, which was the same for all types of regolith.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	This experiment was meant as a test of the sterilization method adjusted to our purposes, as described in the introduction section.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Therefore, we did not plan it according to the maximal theoretically achievable sterilization effect, but to design a life detection mission to Mars.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	4	1	1	The title has been changed.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	5	1	1	In the introduction we already described the problem of the destructiveness of heat sterilization like autoclaving on the organic contents of a soil, which was our motivation to test an alternative method such as low temperature plasma sterilization.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	5	1	1	D. radiodurans was used as test organism because of its resistance towards UV radiation, which is a part of the sterilizing effect of plasma sterilization.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	5	1	1	The appropriate passages in the introduction section have been edited.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	In addition, I think, a control consisting of D. radiodurans cells before and after sterilization is missing to determine the role of the Martian Analog soils.
					0	Reply:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	6	2	1	Since we did not intend to test the influences of the Martian Analog soils on D. radiodurans, but the sterilizing effect of the low temperature plasma treatment on cells intermixed with soil, we did not make a control to determine the effects of the Mars analog soils.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	6	2	1	The starting values of cell numbers were estimated on samples prepared the same way as the samples for the plasma sterilization (intermixed with soils and desiccated as described in the method section).
Author	Reviewer_2	2	6	2	1	They were incubated on TYG agar plates like the plasma samples after the treatment.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	6	2	1	This explanation was missing in the text and has now been added to the appropriate passages in the method section (Chapter 2.2.)
Author	Reviewer_2	2	6	2	1	for a better understanding.

Reviewer_2	Author	1	8	0	2	Line 57: Are you sure that the Martian Analog soils were sterile before using?
					0	Reply:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	11	8	1	Since the bottles containing the Martian Analog soils were autoclaved before use, they should be sterile.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	11	8	1	We also made a separate test to check for sterility after autoclaving the Martian Analog soils, which has been negative (meaning no contamination could be detected via plating of the autoclaved JSC Mars-1A regolith on TYG medium).

Reviewer_2	Author	1	10	0	2	How do you explain the difference between the results when using JSC Mars-1A analog and the other soils?
					0	Reply:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	10	1	The differences might be caused due to the finer grain size of the other regolith used - particularly P-MRS, which possibly increased the shielding effect.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	10	1	This has been added to the discussion section.
