					0	The manuscript entitled “Determination of Mehlich 3 extractable elements with visible and near infrared spectroscopy in a mountainous agricultural land, the Caucasus Mountains” aims to evaluate the potential of VIS-NIR spectroscopy and PLSR modeling to predict M3 extractable elements (Ca, Mg, Cd, Cu, Fe, K, P, Pb, Mn, and Zn) in a representative test area of Caucasus Mountains.
					0	A lot of work has been done.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	38	1	1	We would like to thank you for your valuable comments and directions.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	38	1	1	We have carefully considered all issues and have revised the manuscript completely (e.g.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	38	1	1	separation of section and subheadings, revising all the text, adding paragraphs and references, adding or changing Tables and Figures): 1) Abstract was revised.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	38	1	1	2) Introduction was revised, and 2 new paragraphs were added.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	38	1	1	Such modification leaded to the clear description of the objectives.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	38	1	1	3) Material and Method section was revised.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	38	1	1	Revised version contains 5 subheading.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	38	1	1	4) The results and discussion sections were separated, and their subheadings were reorganized.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	38	1	1	In the revised manuscript the Results contain 5 subheading and Discussion contain 3subheading.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	38	1	1	5) Presentation of the results are improved with consideration of reviewers’ comments.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	38	1	1	a) Original Manuscript contained 3 Tables and 3 Figures.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	38	1	1	Revised manuscript contains 4 Tables and 5 Figures and 1 supplementary table and 1 supplementary figure.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	38	1	1	b) New subheading (3.2. Land use effect on soil properties) was added. It contains new Table 2, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1. c). New Table 4 and Figure 4 were added. Table 4 is related to partial correlation analysis with consideration of soil properties, and Figure 4 is related to the principal component analysis (biplot).
Author	Reviewer_2	2	38	1	1	d) Clarification: Table 1 and Table 3 were not changed. Old Table 2 is new Figure 2. Old Figure 2 is new Figure 3. Old Figure 3 is new Figure 5.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	38	1	1	6) Discussion with new 3 subheading was significantly expanded and linked to the references and the novelty was highlighted.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	38	1	1	7) Conclusions of the study was modified to show its practical outcomes for the local and international readers.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	38	1	1	8) New 12 references were added to update the manuscript to address reviewers’ comments.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	38	1	1	Due to the separating the Results and Discussion section, overlapping of some comments made by the reviewers and associated changes modified all the text of the manuscript was modified.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	38	1	1	Thus, to avoid possible confusion we provided the location (subheading or line) for any change introduced.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	38	1	1	Our point-to-point response to the comments of the reviewers is detailed below.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	38	1	1	Subheading or line numbers refer to the line numbers in the revised manuscript.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	38	1	1	Two version of the manuscript was uploaded: edited main manuscript (with track change), and edited main manuscript (clear).

					0	Is the number of samples sufficient for the purpose of the research?
					0	Please explain.
					0	Response: Thanks.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	40	3	1	The sampling scheme was explained as recommended (M&M, subheading 2.1).
Author	Reviewer_2	2	40	3	1	In general, sampling scale changes between 1:12 000 and 1:250 000 (Soil Survey Staff, USDA NRCS 2016).
Author	Reviewer_2	2	40	3	1	In this pioneering study area, soil properties are highly variable attributed to topography, land use history and land tenure ownerships (mainly 0.2-0.3 hectares and fragmented shrubbery areas) and geological setting that makes difficult to apply regular sampling scheme.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	40	3	1	Therefore, the sampling locations were randomly (irregularly) designated, yet cover variations in land use, topography, geological substrate and the erosive state of soil continuum thereby resulted in 114 samples from 525 ha used under four land use types (1 sample per ~ 5 hectares).
					0	c) Lines 125-135: There should be bibliographic references for the specific methods and their official name should be mentioned.
					0	Reference to formal analytical methods must be made in a scientific manner.
					0	The writing language used must be different from the way an analyst mentions it in the lab.
					0	Response: Thanks.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	41	4	1	Two references were added.
