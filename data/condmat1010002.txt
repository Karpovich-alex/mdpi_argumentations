Author Response 1) The caption has been changed to: "Energy spectrum from Eq.~(\ref{eigqn2}) for $r= 1$ as a function of (i) $\alpha$ in the left panel, and (ii) $k_y$ at $\alpha= 3/5$ in the right panel."
2) We added the following lines in the consluion section: << There are certain similarities observed with the $U(2)$ cases.
For the metal-insulator transition in Sec.~\ref{trans1}, the behaviour of the extended/localized states in the $k_y$-$r$ plane are similar to that in the $U(2)$ case \cite{Clark}.
Again, for the superfluid-insulator transition in Sec.~\ref{trans2}, the presence of the $U(3)$ flux led to a suppression of the values of $J_c$ with respect to the zero fluz case.
Such suppression was also found in the $U(2)$ case \cite{krish-kush}.
In general, it might be easier to simulate U(2) gauge potentials rather than U(3) or higher gauge group potentials in cold atom experiments.
While systems with U(2) gauge potential can be useful to study fermions with the spin degree of freedom, which is what we find in condensed matter systems, the simulation of U(3) gauge potentials may open the path to study QCD-like systems.>> Author Response File: Author Response.pdf
The paper studies ultracold atoms in the the presence of an artificial U(3) gauge potentials.
Artificial gauge fields in the field of ultracold atoms is a rapidly developing field of very high interest.
I think this paper will be interest to readers and support its publication.
By comparing the gauge fields with non-constant and constant Wilson loops, the authors studied the effects of artificial U(3) gauge potentials on ultracold atoms.
The paper reads well and the theoretical model is clearly discussed.
Therefore, I would recommend the manuscript for publication in Condensed Matter after the authors make the minor modifications.
(1) Please rewrite the figure caption of Figure 5 to make the statement of right figure clear.
(2) The authors should put more sentences in conclusion of how U(2) gauge potentials is relevant to artificial U(3) gauge potentials on ultracold atoms.
I am agree with the manuscript for publication in Condensed Matter.

Introduction 8 The study of ultracold atoms in optical lattices has emerged to be a subject of great interest in 9 recent years, opening up the possibilities of synthesising gauge ﬁelds capable of coupling to neutral 10 atoms.
This is in a vein similar to how electromagnetic ﬁelds couple to charged matter, for instance, 11 or how SU(2) and SU(3) ﬁelds couple to fundamental particles in high-energy physics.
[1–10] The 12 effects of these artiﬁcial abelian and non-abelian “magnetic ﬁelds” can subsequently be studied in 13 experiments designed to realise these magnetic ﬁelds.
Over the years several innovative techniques 14 to achieve this have been suggested.
One such procedure involves rotating the atoms in a trap.
[2,11] 15 More sophisticated methods involve atoms in optical lattices, making use of laser-assisted tunnelling 16 and lattice tilting (acceleration) [12–14], laser methods employing dark states [15,16], two-photon 17 dressing by laser ﬁelds [17,18], lattice rotations [19–22], or immersion of atoms in a lattice within a 18 rotating Bose-Einstein condensate.
[23] Further, in a recent work [24], the authors have proposed a 19 two-tripod scheme to generate artiﬁcial U(3) gauge ﬁelds.
Observations in these experiments are 20 expected to show particularly conspicuous features like the fractal “Hofstadter butterﬂy" spectrum 21 [25] and the “Escher staircase" [13] in single-particle spectra, vortex formation [2,19,26], quantum Hall 22 effects [14,21,27,28], as well as other quantum correlated liquids.
[29] 23 A novel scheme to generate artiﬁcial abelian “magnetic" ﬁelds was proposed in the work by 24 Jaksch and Zoller.
[12] This involves the coherent transfer of atoms between two different internal 25 states by making use of Raman lasers.
Later, by making use of laser tunneling between N distinct 26 internal states of an atom, this scheme was generalised to mimic artiﬁcal non-abelian “magnetic" 27 ﬁelds by Osterloh et al.
[30] In addition, an alternative method employing dark states has also 28 been discussed.
[24,31] In such a scenario, one employs atoms with multiple internal states dubbed 29 “ﬂavours”.
The gauge potentials that can be realized by the application of laser-assisted non-uniform 30 and state-dependent tunnelling and coherent transfer between internal states, can practically allow 31 for a unitary matrix transformation in the space of these internal states, corresponding to U(N) or 32 SU(N).
In such a non-abelian U(2) potential, a moth-like structure [30] emerges for the single-particle 33 Submitted to Condens.

Matter 2 of 13 spectrum, which is characterized by numerous tiny gaps.
Several other works involve studies 34 of non-trivial quantum transport properties [32], integer quantum Hall effect for cold atoms [28], 35 spatial patterns in optical lattices [26], modiﬁcations of the Landau levels [33], and quantum atom 36 optics.
[34,35] An SU(3) topological insulator has been constructed for a non-interacting quadratic 37 Hamiltonian.
[36] In the context of an interacting system with three-component bosons, the Mott 38 phase in the presence of “SU(3) spin-orbit coupling" has been shown to exhibit SU(3) spin spiral 39 textures in the ground state, both for one-dimensional chain and the square lattice.
[37] 40 However, Goldman et al [38] have pointed out that the U(2) gauge potentials proposed 41 earlier [30] are characterized by non-constant Wilson loops and that the features characterizing the 42 Hofstadter “moth" are a consequence of this spatial dependence of the Wilson loop, rather than the 43 non-abelian nature of the potential.
They have emphasised that the moth-like spectrum can also be 44 found in the standard abelian case when the gauge potential is chosen such that the Wilson loop is 45 proportional to the spatial coordinate.
46 In this work, we investigate whether features similar to those discussed in the literature for U(2) 47 gauge potentials, also reveal themselves in artiﬁcial U(3) gauge potentials on ultracold atoms.
This 48 builds upon existing results in the literature for U(2) potentials and may be viewed as a stepping 49 stone toward the generalisation of such features for arbitrary (S)U(N) gauge potentials.
50 Our paper is organised as follows.
Sec.
2 describes the necessary theoretical set-up.
In Sec.
3, we 51 consider background gauge ﬁelds with non-constant [30] Wilson loops.
The spectra for both rational 52 and irrational ﬂuxes are discussed.
The scenario of metal-insulator transition for irrational ﬂuxes is 53 also examined in Sec.
3.2.
Sec.
4 is devoted to systems subjected to a gauge potential with a constant 54 [38] Wilson loop.
Lastly, in Sec.
4.2, we study the effect of such a gauge potential on the Mott insulator 55 to superﬂuid transition for bosonic ultracold atoms for rational ﬂuxes.
We conclude with a summary 56 and an outlook for related future work in Sec.

57 2. Review of artiﬁcial gauge potentials in optical lattices 58 In this section, we review the theoretical framework for studying a system of non-interacting fermionic atoms with j ﬂavours.
We assume that the atoms are trapped in a 2D optical square lattice of lattice-spacing a, with sites at (x = m a, y = n a), where n, m are integers.
Without loss of generality, we will set a = 1 in all subsequent discussions.
When the optical potential is strong, the tight-binding approximation holds and the Hamiltonian is given by: H = ∑ m,n  tx Ψ† m+1,n UxΨm,n + ty Ψ† m,n+1 Uy Ψm,n  + h.c., (1) where Ux and Uy are the tunnelling matrices (operators), belonging to the U(N) group, along the 59 x and y directions respectively.
Also, tx and ty represent the corresponding tunnelling amplitudes, 60 and each of the Ψ† m,n’s is a j-component fermion creation operator at the site (m, n).
The tunnelling 61 operators are related to the non-abelian gauge potential according to Ux = eiAx and Uy = eiAy.
62 Throughout this work, we will impose periodic boundary conditions on both x and y directions.
63 In the presence of the gauge potential, the atoms performing a loop around a plaquette undergo the unitary transformation: U = Ux Uy(m + 1) U† x U† y(m) , (2) where we are considering the case that Ux is position-independent, whereas Uy depends on the x-coordinate.
Noting that the gauge potential (and hence the Hamiltonian) is independent of the y-coordinate, the 3-component eigenfunction can be written as: Ψ(m, n) ≡eikyn    am bm cm   , (3) Version July 6, 2016 submitted to Condens.
Matter 3 of 13 such that H |Ψ⟩= E |Ψ⟩.
64 The Wilson loop deﬁned by: W = Tr   Ux(m + 1) Uy(m + 1) U† x(m) U† y(m)  , (4) is a gauge-invariant quantity and can be used to distinguish whether the system is in the “genuine" 65 abelian or non-abelian regime.
For |W| = 3, the system is in the abelian regime according to the 66 criteria by Goldman et al [38].
67 3.
U(3) gauge potential with non-constant Wilson loop 68 In this section, we consider the U(3) gauge potential 69 Ax = 4π 3 √ 3    0 −i i i 0 −i −i i 0   , Ay = −2πm diag(α1 , α2 , α3) , Az = 0 , (5) where Ax is proportional to the linear combination (λ2 −λ5 + λ7) of the Gell-Mann matrices for 70 SU(3).
In order to realize such a potential one may consider the method elaborated by Osterloh et al.
71 [30] 72 The tunnelling operators corresponding to the above non-abelian gauge potentials are given by the following 3 × 3 unitary matrices: Ux =    0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0   , Uy = diag( e−i2πα1m, e−i2πα2m, e−i2πα3m) .
(6) From Eq.
(4), we ﬁnd W = e2 π i{m α1−(m+1) α3} + e2 π i{m α1−(m+1) α3} + e2 π i{m α3−(m+1) α2}, which is 73 position dependent for generic values of α1, α2, α3, and hence we expect a moth-like rather than a 74 butterﬂy-like structure.
[38] For α1 = α2 = α3, |W| = 3 and we are then in the abelian regime where 75 the fractal “Hofstadter butterﬂy" is expected to show up with q1(= q2 = q3) triply-degenerate bands.

Spectrum for rational ﬂuxes 77 For the case of rational αi’s such that αi = pi/qi ( for i ∈{1, 2, 3} & {pi, qi} ∈Z ) , (7) the system is periodic in x-direction with periodicity Q, where Q is equal to the least common multiple 78 of {q1, q2, q3}.
The recursive eigenvalue equations are: 79 bm−1 + Um am + cm+1 = E tx am , cm−1 + Vm bm + am+1 = E tx bm , am−1 + Wm cm + bm+1 = E tx cm , (8) Version July 6, 2016 submitted to Condens.

(9) Since the Hamiltonian H commutes with the translation operator deﬁned by T Q x f (m, n) = 81 f (m + Q, n), we can apply Bloch’s theorem in the x-direction: 82    am+Q cm+Q bm+Q   = eikxQ    am cm bm   .

Metal-insulator transition for irrational ﬂux 91 The Hofstadter system [25] undergoes metal-insulator transitions for irrational values of ﬂux 92 and the spectra do not depend on ky. For instance, let us assume α1 = √ 5−1 2 .
We will approximate 93 this irrational number by the rational approximation 89/144.
Fig.

(12), (13) and (14), as a function of ky for α1 = 89/144, α2 = 2/3, α3 = 1/2 95 and r = 1.
The abelian case corresponding to α1 = α2 = α3 = 89/144 has also been shown, which 96 shows bands with no variation along ky. Also in Fig.

The four ﬁgures in each panel, from top to bottom, show how the state localizes with increasing r. We ﬁnd that if we consider the case of Ay = −2πm diag(α1 , α2 + 1/2 , α3) such that Uy = 99 diag( e−i2πα1m, −e−i2πα2m, e−i2πα3m) (other choices remaining the same as in Eq.
(5)), then for E = 0, 100 α1 irrational and α2 = α3 = 0, the recursive equations reduce to: 101 a(m −3) + a(m + 3) + 2 γ cos  2πmα1 −ky  a(m) = 0 , b(m) = a(m −2) + 2 r (−1)m cos ky a(m + 1) −1 + 4 r2 cos2 ky , c(m) = a(m −1) −b(m + 1) 2 r (−1)m cos ky , γ = −r  1 −4 r2 cos2 ky  .
(14) The a(m) equation is uncoupled and has the structure like that of the Harper equation for the abelian 102 case.
This leads us to infer that there is a metal-insulator transition at |γ| = 1, such that |γ| < 1 103 corresponds to extended states, while |γ| > 1 characterises localized states.
These two phases are 104 shown in Fig.

Superﬂuid-insulator transition of ultracold bosons 119 We consider three independent species of bosonic ultracold atoms, denoted by (am,n, bm,n, cm,n 120 ), in a square optical lattice.
This system is well-captured by the Bose-Hubbard model and has been 121 theoretically shown to undergo superﬂuid-insulator transitions.
Here we study the effect of the U(3) 122 gauge potentials given in Eq.
(16) on such transitions, which result in inter-species hopping terms.
123 Version July 6, 2016 submitted to Condens.
Matter 9 of 13 Starting from the tight-binding limit, we treat these hopping terms perturbatively.
The Hamiltonian 124 of the model is given by: 125 H = H0 + H1 , H0 = ∑ m,n ∑ s=a,b,c hU 2 ˆ ns m,n   ˆ ns m,n −1  −µ ˆ ns m,n i , H1 = J ∑ m,n { Ψ† m+1,n UxΨm,n + Ψ† m,n+1 Uy Ψm,n } + h.c. , ψ† m,n =  a† m,n b† m,n c† m,n  , (20) where the interaction strength U and the chemical potential µ have been chosen to be the same for all 126 species for simplicity.
Here the hopping matrices Ux and Uy are given by Eq.
(16).
We will consider the 127 limit 0 ≤µ ≤U such that H0 describes three independent species having a unique non-degenerate 128 ground state with ns m,n = 1.
129 Following the analysis in earlier papers [39–42], the zeroth order Green’s function 130 (corresponding to H0) at zero temperature is given by: 131 G0 s,s′(k, k′, i ω) = δs,s′ δk,k′ G0(i ω) , G0(i ω) = n0 + 1 i ω −Ep − n0 i ω + Eh , Eh = µ −U (n0 −1) , Ep = −µ + U n0 , (21) where ω is the bosonic Matsubara frequency and Eh (Ep) is the energy cost of adding a hole (particle) 132 to the Mott insulating phase.
Also, n0 = [µ/U] is the on-site particle number.

The x-components of the momenta, in the presence of the ﬂux α, are constrained to lie in the 134 magnetic Brillouin zone where two successive points differ by ±2πα.

space wavefunction as ψℓ(k) ≡ψ(k + 2πα ℓˆ kx).
The hopping matrix, obtained from H1, is then 137 given by: 138 Tk,ℓ,k′,ℓ′ = δk,k′  M1(kx, ℓ) δℓ,ℓ′ + M2(ky) δℓ+1,ℓ′ + M† 2(ky) δℓ−1,ℓ′  , M1(kx, ℓ) = J ei(kx+2πα ℓ) Ux + h.c. = J    0 e−i(kx+2πα ℓ) ei(kx+2πα ℓ) ei(kx+2πα ℓ) 0 e−i(kx+2πα ℓ) e−i(kx+2πα ℓ) ei(kx+2πα ℓ) 0   , M2(ky) = −Jeiky 3    1 2 −2 2 1 2 −2 2 1   .
(22) The dispersion relations can be found by solving: 139 ˜ M1(kx, ℓ) ψℓ(k) −M2(ky) ψℓ+1(k) −M† 2(ky) ψℓ−1(k) = 0 , ˜ M1(kx, ℓ) = [G0(ωr + iη)]−1 I3×3 −M1(kx, ℓ) , (23) where we have analytically continued to real frequencies as i ω →ωr + iη.
In other words, we have 140 to solve the 3Q × 3Q matrix equation: 141          ˜ M1(kx, 0) −2 ℜ[M2(ky)] 0 0 0 .

(24) The value of the critical hopping parameter J = Jc is obtained when the gap between the lowest 142 particle excitation energy and the highest hole excitation energy goes to zero.
The Mott lobes for 143 α = (0, 1/2) are shown in Fig.

Discussion 145 To summarise, we have extended existing studies of ultracold atoms in artiﬁcial U(2) gauge 146 potentials to the case of U(3).
In doing so, we have considered background gauge ﬁelds with both 147 Version July 6, 2016 submitted to Condens.

non-constant and constant Wilson loops.
We ﬁnd that the spectrum for the constant Wilson loop case 148 exhibits a fractal structure very similar to the well-studied abelian case of Hofstader’s.
Systems with 149 irrational ﬂuxes have been shown to undergo metal-insulator transitions as the hopping parameters 150 are tuned.
We have also shown the effect of such a gauge potential in the speciﬁc case of the Mott 151 insulator and for superﬂuid transition for bosonic ultracold atoms subjected to rational ﬂux-values.
152 There are certain similarities observed with the U(2) cases.
For the metal-insulator transition in 153 Sec.
3.2, the behaviour of the extended/localized states in the ky-r plane are similar to that in the U(2) 154 case [32].
Again, for the superﬂuid-insulator transition in Sec.
4.2, the presence of the U(3) ﬂux led to 155 a suppression of the values of Jc with respect to the zero ﬂuz case.
Such suppression was also found 156 in the U(2) case [42].
157 In general, it might be easier to simulate U(2) gauge potentials rather than U(3) or higher gauge 158 group potentials in cold atom experiments.
While systems with U(2) gauge potential can be useful to 159 study fermions with the spin degree of freedom, which is what we ﬁnd in condensed matter systems, 160 the simulation of U(3) gauge potentials may open the path to study QCD-like systems.
161 Our study opens several pathways towards future work involving these systems.
For instance, 162 in the fractal case, the Chern numbers for the emerging energy bands can be calculated leading to 163 the identiﬁcation of the various topological phases.
Further, while for the scope of this work, we 164 have limited ourselves to the simplest case of square lattice, it will be interesting to study cases with 165 other structures such as triangular and honeycomb lattices.
Future exploration along these directions 166 will give a better theoretical understanding of such systems.
It will also help in optimising design 167 related decisions for experiments in the ﬁeld and suggest the experimental signatures one ought to 168 go hunting for.
