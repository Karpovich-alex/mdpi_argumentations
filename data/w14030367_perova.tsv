Reviewer_4	Author	3	2	0	2	Please avoid repeating the full name and abbreviation throughout the manuscript if you used the first-time abbreviation.
Reviewer_4	Author	3	3	0	2	Line 46-52: & line 84-85 “Ultrafiltration (UF) as an emerging alternative technology to conventional water treatment processes, has been widely used to remove pollutants such as particles, colloids, bacteria, and viruses, thus reducing the risk of water-borne diseases [10].
Reviewer_4	Author	3	3	0	2	Size exclusion is considered the primary removal mechanism for the UF.
Reviewer_4	Author	3	3	0	2	However, in the case of the PPCPs with a small molecular weight (typically < 600 Da), UF membranes also cannot effectively reject these PPCPs, but nanofiltration and reverse osmosis are able to remove these PPCPs based on the thin-film composite”.
Reviewer_4	Author	3	3	0	2	Sorry, but I don't see why UF can reject viruses and bacteria but not PPCPs.
Reviewer_4	Author	3	3	0	2	Is it true that the molecular weight of viruses and bacteria is more than that of PPCPs?
Reviewer_4	Author	3	3	0	2	Please elaborate.
Reviewer_4	Author	3	4	0	2	The authors should include some information regarding the biological degradation of PPCPs by microorganisms in the introduction section.
Reviewer_4	Author	3	5	0	2	Line 53-55:
Author	Reviewer_4	4	5	5	1	“The combined process with ultrafiltration may be another promising choice, featuring a comparable removing performance as the nanofiltration and low operational cost”.
Reviewer_4	Author	3	5	0	2	Have the authors compared the BAC-UF performance to that of nanofiltration?
Reviewer_4	Author	3	6	0	2	I strongly suggest that the authors explain how they performed the t-tests.

					0	Please explain it in the manuscript.
					0	The reviewer suggests statistical analysis using a t-test (Raw water- BAC-Effluent and Raw water – BAC/UF-effluent).
					0	Response 6:
Author	Reviewer_4	4	10	10	1	Thanks very much for this comment.
Reviewer_4	Author	3	10	0	2	The same trend (Figure 2) was mainly due to the stable removal ability of BAC and UF for organics, causing the removal restriction.
Reviewer_4	Author	3	10	0	2	The periodic backwash (7days) of BAC caused sometimes the dissolved oxygen concentration of BAC-effluent higher than that of raw water.
Reviewer_4	Author	3	10	0	2	After the gas scrubbing and the hydraulic backwashing, the dissolved oxygen detection of the effluent was carried out, resulting in the above results for dissolved oxygen.
Reviewer_4	Author	3	10	0	2	Besides, the t-test was used and proved the significant difference between BAC-Effluent and BAC/UF-effluent.

					0	Response to Reviewer 1 Comments Point 1: The innovation of this research needs to be better explored.
					0	Response 1:
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	5	1	The BAC biofilter can remove the PPCPs, and then the following UF can reject micro-organisms and particles flowing out from the biofilter to ensure the quality of drinking water.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	5	1	The above coupling process makes up for the defects concerning respective operations of the BAC biofilter and UF.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	5	1	Although many pilot-scale setups were used to treat secondary wastewater effluent for water reclamation, this type of raw water quality was different from the river water, causing the different potential of biofilm growing.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	5	1	As far as we investigated, the lack of enough attention to long-term pilot study exists.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	5	1	Therefore, in this study, a BAC-UF system was carried out for several months with pilot scale to access the long-term removal performances and the respective contributions of BAC and UF.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	The innovation of this research has been clarified in the abstract, the introduction, and the conclusion.

					0	However, the long-term pilot-scale study is urge to be investigated.
					0	In this study, a 17 BAC-UF system with treatment capacity of 0.16 m3/h was operated.
					0	The water quality was analyzed 18 including CODMn, UV254, NH4+-N and PPCPs.
					0	The results showed that the BAC unit reduced CODMn 19 with 35.45%, while the BAC-UF further decreased to 56.00%.
					0	The concentration of ammonia nitro- 20 gen in the raw water was closely related to the removal rate of BAC-UF on ammonia nitrogen.
					0	Nev- 21 ertheless, BAC and UF were both related to the removal effects of NH4+-N, NO2−-N and NO3−-N. 22 Importantly, the BAC-UF process showed high efficiency in the removal PPCPs micropollutants 23 and the average removal of total PPCPs reached 47.84%, especially Anhydroerythromycin, Sul- 24 fachloropyridazine, Sulfadiazine, Trimethoprim, and Caffeine.
					0	It was found that the BAC unit 25 played a key role in PPCPs removal and the UF unit also degraded them by the biomass on UF 26 membranes.
					0	Therefore, this study proved the removal performance of BAC-UF for treating popular 27 pollutants from surface water.
					0	The BAC-UF process in this work was considered feasible to produce 28 clean drinking water.

					0	Introduction 33 Over the last few decades, the risks of pharmaceutical and personal care products 34 (PPCPs) in the aquatic environment have taken a worldwide issue in environmental con- 35 cern [1, 2].
					0	The PPCPs catalog includes a variety of chemicals, such as human and veteri- 36 nary drugs, fragrances and disinfectants used in personal care products (e.g., soaps, lo- 37 tions, sun-screens and body cleaning products) and household chemicals [3].
					0	These 38 PPCPs generally present in waters at trace concentrations, ranging from several ng/L to 39 thousands μg/L [4].
					0	The concentrations and diversities complicate the associated detec- 40 tion and even create challenges for water purification processes.
					0	Generally, many PPCPs 41 flow through conventional water treatment processes with little degradation due to their 42 persistency or/and the continuous introduction [5].

Author	Reviewer_3	2	23	15	1	The added paragraph is as follows: PPCPs risks have been posing severe challenges to the safety of drinking water supply in rural areas due to the absence of the process with simple operation and maintenance as well as reliable performance.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	23	15	1	In this study, BAC coupling gravi-ty-driven UF was performed continuously, and the rejection performance of mem-brane filtration and BAC filtration both showed barriers for the conventional pollu-tants and PPCPs.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	23	15	1	Furthermore, this study indicated the respective contributions of BAC and UF, showing the role of the two-stage biofilm.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	23	15	1	Previous works involving BAC generally combined the ozonation with the BAC filter for treating the contaminants of emerging concern, eliminating a majority of PPCPs by more than 90% [34].
Author	Reviewer_3	2	23	15	1	However, the regulation and maintenance of machines for ozone products are complicated, and the disinfection by-products will be newly generated in the effluent, which is incon-venient to use in rural areas [35].
Author	Reviewer_3	2	23	15	1	In general, coagulation, filtration and single BAC units worked inefficiently and removed the detected PPCPs by less than 50%, as they were not hydrophobic [34, 36].
Author	Reviewer_3	2	23	15	1	Hybrid membrane processes such as inline dosing of powdered activated carbon (PAC) prior to UF have already shown promising potential for the abatement of PPCPs; however, the inline dosing PAC is infeasible in rural areas [37].
Author	Reviewer_3	2	23	15	1	In this study, the BAC prior to UF enhanced the biological activity by forming a two-stage biofilm system.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	23	15	1	Therefore, the integrated BAC-UF process can be considered as an economically and technically feasible approach to the decentralized and emer-gency drinking water treatment.

					0	After the gas scrubbing and the hydraulic backwashing, the dissolved oxygen detection of the effluent was carried out, resulting in the above results for dissolved oxygen.
					0	Besides, the t-test was used and proved the significant difference between BAC-Effluent and BAC/UF-effluent.

Author	Reviewer_4	4	10	10	1	With a turbulent current and dozens of kilometers in length, this river is located in the mountains of Foshan city.
Author	Reviewer_4	4	10	10	1	The PPCPs sludge at the bottom of the river never executes removal.
Author	Reviewer_4	4	10	10	1	Thanks for the suggestion from the reviewer.
Author	Reviewer_4	4	10	10	1	We will further precipitate the PPCPs sludge before the water treatment plant or excavate the PPCPs sludge from the river and study the effects on drinking water quality.
Author	Reviewer_4	4	10	10	1	The relevant results will be published in another paper in the future.
