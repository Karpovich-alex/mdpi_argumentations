					0	The system we have used is to refer to the table with statistical values when reporting significant differences for the results presented in figures and tables, but for those that are presented in the text only, we also have P- and F-values in brackets.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	Insted of inserting P-values in the text when reporting significant differences for the ones that are in tables, we have included more references to the stat-tables.
					0	I hope the reviewer find that satisfactory.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	12	4	1	There is always effects of batches in these types of studies.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	12	4	1	This is also why we prefer to have several batches, but the main effect should not be biased by the batch effect in the present study, as the main finding are quite clear even in our small data set.
					0	However, it would be more elegant to have more batches.
					0	This was unfortunately not possible in the present iinnovation project.
					0	As mentioned earlier, we did not have resources t continue the data collection within the time period we had.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	In the introduction, (Line 76 79), you present the objectives, but those are not clear, I respectfully suggest focusing on your hypothesis 2.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Line 78: You wrote, “designed to meet the basic behavioral needs of the sow at farrowing”, but this is not tested on the paper.
					0	3.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Lines 80 – 83 moves to discussion section 4.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	Figure 1 is missing 5.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	5	0	2	Figure 2 needs more description, maybe include which wall… Please describe units of the dimensions 6.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	Figure 4. Please indicate which is “sowconf” and which is “trad”. In the left graph the units are in m2, but in right side it does not have unit, seems ar?
					0	7.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	Line 206: I don’t understand why you use just 10 o 12 sows, 50% primi and multiparous, but in line 225 mentioned that “there were no secure information about sow parity” please be consistent.
					0	8.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	8	0	2	Please include P values when report significant differences.
					0	The paper deals with an interesting topic and totally up to date to provide farmers with solutions for free farrowing (which in Europe may become mandatory under The End of the Cage Age initiative).
					0	The paper is clearly written, with nice figures and with a discussion supported by the results obtained.
					0	There are only minor comments with very specific issues:
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	Figure 1 does not appear in the pdf that this reviewer could download.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	Only the Figure Caption appears.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	It is not totally clear to the reviewer how stillborn piglets were evaluated as compared to “piglets with no milk in stomach”.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	Line 224-225, it states that that no information/security on the productivity data on whether it was primiparous or multiparous sow.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	Again this creates a bit of confusion.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	Sows were recorded, 50% primiparous and 50% multiparous to evaluate behaviour, and results are discussed accorging to that (lines 320-321).
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	Why productivity data was not available?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	Figure 5 and 7 display the overall causes of mortality for the three batches.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	However, differences in batches were found.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	Could this overall causes be biased by this batch effect?
