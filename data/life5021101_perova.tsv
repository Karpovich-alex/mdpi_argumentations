Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	"It would be better to have a short but clear description about what ""bending elasticity modulus"" is and its relevance to biological functions."
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Bending modulus is a material constant which does not depend on the size and shape of the object, but on the composition of the vesicle membrane and aqueous solution used (Lines 121–123 in the new version).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	We have inserted a definition of the membrane bending modulus (Lines 115–116) while the text regarding this issue extends between Lines 112–128.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	The theory section could be in the Method section with both principle and procedures to get kc values.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	As the referee suggested The Theory and Experimental section were organized into the Section “Materials and Methods”.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Other sections were renumbered accordingly.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	However, not all results seem to be presented.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	For example, it is not clear what kind of images were recorded, which were used to calculate the kc values, what the sizes/shapes of the fluctuating vesicles looked like.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	How these observations would be different or similar to other types of vesicles.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	As it was explained in the text our experimental method is developed for application to almost spherical vesicles.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Vesicles with diameters between 20 and 40 micrometers were considered, whose deviations from spherical shape (fluctuation of the radius) were small in comparison with the mean sphere radius.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	We added the information concerning the shape and the size of the studied objects and added pictures of the equatorial cross section of a fluctuating vesicle (new Figure 3), as seen under the phase contrast microscope.
					0	R2
Reviewer_1	Author	3	1	0	2	It is also not clear about the “thermally induced shape fluctuations”, such as the temperatures and incubation length and etc., especially this is a hyperthermophilic archaeal membrane vesicle, which would be expected to be more thermostable than those eukaryotic ones.
					0	Response:
Reviewer_1	Author	3	1	0	2	The observed fluctuations of the membrane do not destabilize it.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	1	0	2	However, the comment of the reviewer is notable and we state in the conclusion of the manuscript (Lines 229–232) that at room temperature the thermophilicity is not necessarily related to the bending elasticity.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	It would also be helpful to clarify/expand the description about the drug delivery system using the archaeal vesicle.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	The first sentence in the introduction section should be corrected as cell should not be considered to be “the building block of life”.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	It’s better to re-write the “basic motivation” for the study.
					0	Response:
Reviewer_1	Author	1	5	0	2	We have rewritten the introductory paragraph (Lines 46–60).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	There are two reference lists, one for 1–31 and another from 1–34.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	There are repeated ones.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	It’s not clear why the case was.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	Thank you for the comment, there was a mistake.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	We have tidied and updated the references.
					0	Round 1: and Author Response
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	This manuscript described the measurement of bending elasticity of giant vesicles (GVs) prepared by archaea-derived lipids.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	Stroboscopic illumination measurements of GVs and theoretical models about shape fluctuation of GVs revealed that the archaeal lipid-based GVs showed the almost same value of bending elasticity modulus with synthetic lipid-based GVs.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	According to the authors, this is the first report for the measurement of bending elasticity modulus for archaeal lipid-based GVs.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	The measurement itself is novel, but same methods and theories have been reported in the authors’ previous papers.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	In addition, the number of tables and figures are too low for article.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	If could, the author should add other experimental data.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	1	1	As the referee suggested, we have added data for the bending elasticity modulus of another lipid type—POPC lipid membrane.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	1	1	Also, we have added a new figure (Figure 3).
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	I also have questions and comments for acceptance.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	The list of comments is as follows.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	In Page 1, Lines 27–28, the author described “the experimental set-up was improved …”.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	However, the authors have already reported the measurements of bending elasticity using stroboscopic illumination in author’s previous papers (such as Genova et al., J. Optoelectro.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	Adv.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	Mat., 2005).
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	Describe how the experimental set-up was improved in this paper more precisely.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	8	2	1	A number of improvements of the experimental procedure for the thermally induced shape fluctuation method were used in this study: the stroboscopic illumination was improved on several steps to achieve a better experimental conditions; a thermostatic stage was used to set and control a constant temperature, the analysing procedure was improved by adding strict objective criteria for qualification of the vesicle as a whole as well as for acceptance or rejection of a given contour of the sequence of recorded images and the white noise contribution to the amplitudes of thermal shape fluctuations was R3 evaluated and taken into account.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	8	2	1	We have given short description of the improvements made and for each of them cited the corresponding articles for detailed explanation.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	8	2	1	(Lines 181–184; 187–193).
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	As a comparison of archaeal lipids, SOPC was used in this study.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	SOPC contains an unsaturated bond in its alkyl chains and its transition temperature seems to be quite low compared with archaeal lipids.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	What is the reason why the authors selected the SOPC for the representative of eukaryotic lipids?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	9	3	1	SOPC was chosen as both lipid types have transition temperature far below the temperature at experiments.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	9	3	1	In the revised version, we measured the bending modulus for another lipid type (POPC), measured and analysed by the same method for the same experimental conditions.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	In page 4, between line 108 and 109, this equation should be numbered as (6).
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	4	1	We have corrected the wrong number.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	5	0	2	Describe the temperature condition for measurement of fluctuation of GVs.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	5	0	2	Are there any effects of temperature on the fluctuation of GVs?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	11	5	1	The aim of the present study was to obtain the bending elasticity modulus of the archaeal membrane at fixed temperature (27 degrees C) far above the phase transition temperature.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	11	5	1	We have not measured the temperature dependence of the bending constant.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	6	0	2	In this paper, bending elasticity modulus was measured in pure water.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	6	0	2	Are there any effects of ionic strength or composition of solution on the fluctuation of GVs?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	12	6	1	In this work we present the bending elasticity modulus of archaeal lipid membrane in pure water environment.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	12	6	1	We added the details concerning the water purification (Lines 173–175).
Author	Reviewer_2	2	12	6	1	In other works the influence of different admixtures in the aqueous solution around the membrane was studied and the values depending on the type and the concentration of it for given lipid were reported.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	12	6	1	As the referee suggested we added such information with the corresponding references in the introduction section (Lines 57–60).
					0	Second Round of Evaluation Round 2: and Author Response It is also not clear about the “thermally induced shape fluctuations”, such as the temperatures and incubation length and etc., especially this is a hyperthermophilic archaeal membrane vesicle, which would be expected to be more thermostable than those eukaryotic ones.
					0	The observed fluctuations of the membrane do not destabilize it.
					0	However, the comment of the reviewer is notable and we state in the conclusion of the manuscript (Lines 229–232) that at room temperature the thermophilicity is not necessarily related to the bending elasticity.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	4	1	1	1	We thank the reviewer for further comments and hope that we can clarify the issues as given below.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	1	1	1	We have made changes in the manuscript (marked red) and added one new reference (ref. [35]).
Reviewer_1	Author	3	2	0	2	If only measured at one temperature, how would it be possible to draw a conclusion with “thermally induced shape fluctuations”?
					0	R4 Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	4	2	2	1	In principal in order to obtain elastic constants you need to apply force and measure the deformation that this force causes.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	2	2	1	If we want to obtain the bending elasticity of lipid vesicle we need a force with a very small power.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	2	2	1	In the case of thermally induced shape fluctuations as a force we use the Brownian (thermal) motion of water molecules, bombarding the membrane.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	2	2	1	This force is stochastic (we do not know its instant value), but the mean value of it is proportional to the temperature.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	2	2	1	As a result of this stochastic bombardment the lipid vesicle deforms (changes its shape or fluctuates).
Author	Reviewer_1	4	2	2	1	We acquire a big amount of pictures of fluctuating vesicle in order to get the mean value of the deformation that our force causes.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	2	2	1	To extract mean we need to have stationary conditions over the time, so the mean is taken, that is why it is really important to have constant temperature throughout the experiment.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	3	0	2	Is it possible to do the measurement at elevated temperatures?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	4	3	3	1	Using our experimental system we can measure bending elasticity also at higher temperatures (up to approximately 40 degrees C).
Reviewer_1	Author	3	4	0	2	Would kc be temperature dependent?
Reviewer_1	Author	3	4	0	2	If yes, what would be the valid range?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	4	4	4	1	The bending elasticity modulus depends on the temperature below and near the phase transition temperature, but far above the phase transition temperature (this is the case in our experiment) the bending elasticity modulus is practically constant.

Author	Reviewer_1	4	4	4	1	Lett., 28, 181 (1994).
Author	Reviewer_1	4	4	4	1	We have added this text to the Discussion (Lines 234–237) and also added the reference to the reference list (ref.
					0	[35]).
Reviewer_1	Author	3	5	0	2	The photo added merely shows the shape, but is it possible to show a few time related changes of the shape at different temperatures?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	4	5	5	1	It is not a problem for us to make pictures of a fluctuating vesicle at different temperatures, but these photos would not be related to the manuscript.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	6	0	2	The numbering from Lines 306–307 may not be correct as there are two 2.2.

Author	Reviewer_1	4	6	6	1	We thank the referee for pointing to negligent mistakes in numbering.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	6	6	1	We have corrected wrong numbering of subsections.
