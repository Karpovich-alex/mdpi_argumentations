Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	TITLE The “Part 1” in the title, while perhaps intriguing, calls for some explanation of future directions.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	This does not seem to be addressed in the article, thus there seems to be no reason to include this phrase in the title.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	The second part of this analysis, titled: “Body composition assessment in Mexican children and adolescents.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Part 2: Cross-validation of three bio-electrical impedance methods against dual X-ray absorptiometry for whole-body and regional body composition”, has already been accepted by Nutrients #1604578.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	The two analyses were conducted on the same children’s database and closely complement each other.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	As the accepted manuscript already includes the phrase ‘Part 2’ we prefer to keep ‘Part 1’ here ABSTRACT 2.
					0	Regarding “The clinical context in which BC is evaluated usually defines the ideal model to be used”: This is somewhat confusing.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Perhaps a simpler definition or specification could be used here, as clinical ‘context’ more often dictates the availability of methods, not necessarily models.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Cost, manpower, location, all play a role in driving the selection of BC techniques.

					0	P2 L61: FFM is obtained via the 4C model – it is not a surrogate.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Also, the difference(s) between FFM and LM definitions are nuanced and complex and should either be defined, or alternate text should be used here.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	It seems that the authors are simply trying to point out that use of the 4C model is not common and that other methods are normally used.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	Best to clarify this statement.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Corrected, we adjusted this paragraph together with the next one to give a clearer explanation of the motivation of this study.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	P2 L69: The aim stated here does not follow the logic of the preceding statements in the paragraph, i.e., what does comparing BC methods have to do with lack of healthcare or technology?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	Is the focus then on finding low cost, easy to apply methods?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	The aim (and intent) of the study seems too simplistic as stated here – merely comparing methods.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	How would the results be applied to the healthcare situation in Mexico?
					0	These topics should be tied together, or an alternative motivation needs to be presented.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	We have adjusted accordingly.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	P3 L125: DXA: Was the head ROI excluded from the analyses (as per recommendation by the ISCD)?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	If so, it should be stated.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	6	0	2	If not, DXA analysis should be redone and all relationships recalculated.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	6	6	1	The data used was total body with head, as recommended for the ISCD when using DXA for body composition instead of for bone densitometry.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	14	0	2	P12 L283: Is Table 4 necessary?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	14	0	2	The title (and aim?)
Reviewer_1	Author	1	14	0	2	of the paper is all about comparing techniques against the 4C model.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	14	0	2	One also begins to wonder about affecting type 1 errors due to multiplicity of comparisons (debatable but worth considering).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	14	0	2	It may be worth considering moving Table 4 to the supplementary file and bringing supplementary Table 1 into the main document.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	14	0	2	If the focus (see the title) of the article is comparisons with the 4C model, then supplementary Table 1 seems to merit more direct attention.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	14	14	1	We have corrected as recommended.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	17	0	2	It should perhaps be the last paragraph in the Discussion.
					0	Changed OVERALL
Reviewer_1	Author	1	18	0	2	Much of the Discussion addresses strengths and weaknesses of the different BC methods, as if to provide guidance for clinicians in selecting the best techniques according to their needs and capabilities.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	18	0	2	None of the methods are ideal – all are flawed (in comparison with a gold standard).
Reviewer_1	Author	1	18	0	2	Yet a firm conclusion seems to be lacking.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	18	0	2	Concluding that methods differ is not surprising.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	18	0	2	One may be better served by discussing how the differences in methods (i.e.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	18	0	2	over or under estimating FM) may affect health assessments.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	18	0	2	That is, what impact may underestimating FM, by relying on one particular method, have on child care?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	18	0	2	How critical is the method selection?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	18	0	2	Somehow this needs to be tied more firmly to the population and environment being studied.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	18	18	1	We have stated in the conclusion that while individual methods show bias relative to the 4-component reference, the high correlations indicate that all the methods perform well in ranking individual children as having high or low FFM and fat mass.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	18	18	1	This ranking is itself very valuable in routine clinical care, particularly for longitudinal assessment.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	18	18	1	We have provided new evidence for the Mexican population that all the methods have utility for this purpose.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	18	18	1	Furthermore, some of the biases for individual methods can be resolved by the publication of method-specific reference data, whereby all data can be converted to method-specific z-scores.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	18	18	1	Publishing such reference data is a further aim of our project.

					0	Author Response Reviewer two comments:
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	I am not familiar with the Bland-Altman method, so was unclear when I read the methods section whether the text in lines 204-207 was explaining the Bland-Altman method or describing a separate procedure.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	"I take from the results that those sentences were describing the Bland-Altman procedure, and if so, adding some text along the lines of ""In this procedure..."" would be helpful."
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	As it was, I couldn't understand the description provided, and it didn't seem to match the figures, which were simply labeled as FM, so seemed to be a simple plots of FM using 2 methods on first read.
					0	Added 2.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	"Relatedly, it would have been helpful to have more explanatory titles for the plots--eg ""Differential correlation between methods across levels of FM""."
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	And, the meaning of the trend line was very counter-intuitive, so an interpretive note under the plots would have been helpful.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	"(E.g., ""A positive trend indicates increasing underestimation of FM at high FM levels; a negative trend indicates increasing overestimation of FM at high FM levels."
Author	Reviewer_2	2	20	2	1	Added to supplementary figure 1 and main figures 1 and 2 3.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	There is no description of the race and ethnic composition of the sample.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	I am not well-versed in the ethnic composition of Mexico, however, would it be helpful to know the degree of representation of, for example, youth who are Black, of Indigenous ancestry, and of European ancestry?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	Or are there other ethnic or cultural groups that should be represented?
Author	Reviewer_2	2	21	3	1	Specified in limitations lines 993-997.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	21	3	1	Important to say is that ~89% of Mexican population is Hispanic.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	21	3	1	Only 6.6% belong to indigenous population and 5.9% to Afro-Mexican ethnic groups.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	22	4	1	In the previous version we put data of the whole sample of 293 subjects (including 5 outliers that should not been there).

					0	Or are there other ethnic or cultural groups that should be represented?
					0	Specified in limitations lines 993-997.
					0	Important to say is that ~89% of Mexican population is Hispanic.
					0	Only 6.6% belong to indigenous population and 5.9% to Afro-Mexican ethnic groups.
					0	I didn't understand why the data differed between Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1.
					0	Why did Ns (and means/SDs) differ?
					0	Corrected.
					0	In the previous version we put data of the whole sample of 293 subjects (including 5 outliers that should not been there).
					0	We have corrected the data, and now we only present data on the 288 subjects for both tables.
					0	Not all abbreviations are listed for the table footnotes (FFM, D2O, DXA, LM, BV, ADP) Added to table 1.
					0	I hope that you find this work suitable for your Journal and I look forward to hearing from you.

					0	Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez Instituto Nacional de Salud UNIDAD DE EPIDEMIOLOGÍA CLÍNICA Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez Instituto Nacional de Salud UNIDAD DE EPIDEMIOLOGÍA CLÍNICA Mexico City, February 23, 2022 To the Editorial Board and Expert Reviewers: We, the authors, want to express our gratitude to the Editorial Board and the experts that reviewed our manuscript for their contributions.
					0	We have found your recommendations and commentaries of great value and have made appropriate changes.
					0	We feel confident that the manuscript has been strengthened by this.
					0	Please find our answers in the following lines.
					0	Response to reviewers' comments: Reviewer one: TITLE The “Part 1” in the title, while perhaps intriguing, calls for some explanation of future directions.
					0	This does not seem to be addressed in the article, thus there seems to be no reason to include this phrase in the title.
					0	The second part of this analysis, titled: “Body composition assessment in Mexican children and adolescents.
					0	Part 2: Cross-validation of three bio-electrical impedance methods against dual X-ray absorptiometry for whole-body and regional body composition”, has already been accepted by Nutrients #1604578.
					0	The two analyses were conducted on the same children’s database and closely complement each other.
					0	As the accepted manuscript already includes the phrase ‘Part 2’ we prefer to keep ‘Part 1’ here ABSTRACT Regarding “The clinical context in which BC is evaluated usually defines the ideal model to be used”: This is somewhat confusing.
					0	Perhaps a simpler definition or specification could be used here, as clinical ‘context’ more often dictates the availability of methods, not necessarily models.
					0	Cost, manpower, location, all play a role in driving the selection of BC techniques.
					0	Changed, line 19 INTRODUCTION P2 L61: FFM is obtained via the 4C model – it is not a surrogate.
					0	Also, the difference(s) between FFM and LM definitions are nuanced and complex and should either be defined, or alternate text should be used here.
					0	It seems that the authors are simply trying to point out that use of the 4C model is not common and that other methods are normally used.
					0	Best to clarify this statement.
					0	Corrected, we adjusted this paragraph together with the next one to give a clearer explanation of the motivation of this study.
					0	P2 L69: The aim stated here does not follow the logic of the preceding statements in the paragraph, i.e., what does comparing BC methods have to do with lack of healthcare or technology?
					0	Is the focus then on finding low cost, easy to apply methods?
					0	The aim (and intent) of the study seems too simplistic as stated here – merely comparing methods.
					0	How would the results be applied to the healthcare situation in Mexico?
					0	These topics should be tied together, or an alternative motivation needs to be presented.
					0	We have adjusted accordingly.
					0	We hope now we can give a clearer explanation about the motivation of this study.
					0	MATERIALS AND METHODS P3 L94: This is awkwardly worded.
					0	Who was asked to assent?
					0	Clarified in lines 164.
					0	P3 L125: DXA: Was the head ROI excluded from the analyses (as per recommendation by the ISCD)?
					0	If so, it should be stated.
					0	If not, DXA analysis should be redone and all relationships recalculated.
					0	The data used was total body with head, as recommended for the ISCD when using DXA for body composition instead of for bone densitometry.
					0	We clarified and referenced this in the text, lines 204-208.
					0	P5 L176: “(n=52??
					0	)” Is there uncertainty of the number of participants or is this merely a typo?
					0	This was a typo, we corrected it.
					0	Line 260.
					0	P5 L191: TBW should be in liters, not kg.
					0	Corrected.
					0	P5 L207: The means of FM would be compared using t-test, not calculated.
					0	We corrected (lines 287-288).
					0	RESULTS Table 1: The n values in the column headers add up to 293 rather than 288.
					0	Are the n values incorrect or is the entire cohort presented here?
					0	Indeed, it was like that.
					0	We have changed it to show only the data of the 288 subjects (without the 5 outliers).
					0	Table 1; Body Composition Variables: The mean values do not all agree with those in supplementary Table 1.
					0	This was because of the inclusion of the 5 outliers in table 1, which has been corrected.
					0	Table 1; MRI subsample: There is no indication of age, BMI, etc.
					0	in this group.
					0	That information may be helpful, perhaps also as supplementary data.
					0	We have added this in supplementary table as S table 1.
					0	P7 L226: It would be helpful if it was made clear that this refers to comparisons of means of all subjects (not broken down by age, sex).
					0	Added, the analysis was for the total sample and by subgroups by age and sex, line 287 P12 L283: Is Table 4 necessary?
					0	The title (and aim?)
					0	of the paper is all about comparing techniques against the 4C model.
					0	One also begins to wonder about affecting type 1 errors due to multiplicity of comparisons (debatable but worth considering).
					0	It may be worth considering moving Table 4 to the supplementary file and bringing supplementary Table 1 into the main document.
					0	If the focus (see the title) of the article is comparisons with the 4C model, then supplementary Table 1 seems to merit more direct attention.
					0	We have corrected as recommended.
					0	Table 4 sent to supplementary material as supplementary table 3.
					0	P13 L294: The legend for Figure 3 seems incorrect.
					0	It matches that for Figure 1.
					0	Corrected.
					0	As stated above, it may be worth considering moving these Bland-Altman figures to the supplementary file.
					0	Changed as supplementary figure 3.
					0	DISCUSSION P15 L393: This paragraph reads more like a conclusion and seem out of place.
					0	It should perhaps be the last paragraph in the Discussion.
					0	Changed OVERALL Much of the Discussion addresses strengths and weaknesses of the different BC methods, as if to provide guidance for clinicians in selecting the best techniques according to their needs and capabilities.
					0	None of the methods are ideal – all are flawed (in comparison with a gold standard).
					0	Yet a firm conclusion seems to be lacking.
					0	Concluding that methods differ is not surprising.
					0	One may be better served by discussing how the differences in methods (i.e.
					0	over or under estimating FM) may affect health assessments.
					0	That is, what impact may underestimating FM, by relying on one particular method, have on child care?
					0	How critical is the method selection?
					0	Somehow this needs to be tied more firmly to the population and environment being studied.
					0	We have stated in the conclusion that while individual methods show bias relative to the 4-component reference, the high correlations indicate that all the methods perform well in ranking individual children as having high or low FFM and fat mass.
					0	This ranking is itself very valuable in routine clinical care, particularly for longitudinal assessment.
					0	We have provided new evidence for the Mexican population that all the methods have utility for this purpose.
					0	Furthermore, some of the biases for individual methods can be resolved by the publication of method-specific reference data, whereby all data can be converted to method-specific z-scores.
					0	Publishing such reference data is a further aim of our project.
					0	Reviewer two comments: I am not familiar with the Bland-Altman method, so was unclear when I read the methods section whether the text in lines 204-207 was explaining the Bland-Altman method or describing a separate procedure.
					0	"I take from the results that those sentences were describing the Bland-Altman procedure, and if so, adding some text along the lines of ""In this procedure..."" would be helpful."
					0	As it was, I couldn't understand the description provided, and it didn't seem to match the figures, which were simply labeled as FM, so seemed to be a simple plots of FM using 2 methods on first read.
					0	"Added Relatedly, it would have been helpful to have more explanatory titles for the plots--eg ""Differential correlation between methods across levels of FM""."
					0	And, the meaning of the trend line was very counter-intuitive, so an interpretive note under the plots would have been helpful.
					0	"(E.g., ""A positive trend indicates increasing underestimation of FM at high FM levels; a negative trend indicates increasing overestimation of FM at high FM levels."
					0	Added to supplementary figure 1 and main figures 1 and 2 There is no description of the race and ethnic composition of the sample.
					0	I am not well-versed in the ethnic composition of Mexico, however, would it be helpful to know the degree of representation of, for example, youth who are Black, of Indigenous ancestry, and of European ancestry?
					0	Or are there other ethnic or cultural groups that should be represented?
					0	Specified in limitations lines 993-997.
					0	Important to say is that ~89% of Mexican population is Hispanic.
					0	Only 6.6% belong to indigenous population and 5.9% to Afro-Mexican ethnic groups.

					0	Why did Ns (and means/SDs) differ?
