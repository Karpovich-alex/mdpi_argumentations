The given topic about the effect of antibiotics on the mung sprouts features is very interesting and highly important for food safety.
The article is written in a very good form in all neccessary part.
The only minor formal error is that the lines names miss in Figure 2.
Generally, I recommend this article for publishing in the present version.
Comments and suggestions for authors are provided below and for supplementary materials in an attached file.

Reviewer A Comment’s: I have completed a review of the manuscript “Effects of typical antimicrobials on growth performance, morphology and antimicrobial residues of mung bean sprouts” (Antibiotics - 1738611).
The aim of this study was to understand and elucidate This study aimed to investigate the role of antimicrobials in the growth of mung bean sprouts and to clarify antimicrobial residues in the cultivation of mung bean sprouts.
I congratulate the authors for their excellent work, the research is of great importance for the field of the pharmacology and has technical and scientific merit.
The information generated will be of great value.
The findings indicated that the abuse of antimicrobials might cause potential food safety risks in fast growing vegetables and the monitoring of antimicrobial residues might be necessary to guarantee food safety.
Overall the manuscript is a well-designed study, the figures are of good quality and the text is mostly adequate, data were analyzed properly, the search results are consistent and very interesting and it fits the scope of the journal well.
Dear Reviewer： Thank you for your letter and your kind comments.
We are very sorry for the confusion we have caused you.

Response: Thank you for this kind comment.
The names of the lines in Figure 2 are indicated in the notes below the Figure 2.
Each line represents the growth of mung bean sprouts in the same antimicrobial group at 24h, 48h, 72h and 96h, respectively.
Each column represents the growth of different antimicrobial groups at the same time.
We would like to express our great appreciation for your warm work earnestly, and hope that the explanation will meet with approval.
Thank you and best regards.
Yours sincerely, Jing Cao.
