Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Corrected the legend of Figure 4
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	(EM/HPHYT/BHT, EM/HPHYT, ET/HPHYT).
					0	2.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	In Figure 4, the results is represented in three times or signal one or other times.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Therefore, you must rewritten the legend of Figure 4.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	The errors were corrected in text on page 09.
					0	(EM/HPHYT/BHT, EM/HPHYT, ET/HPHYT).
					0	Round 1: and Author Response
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	We recommend “galenic” can be changed to herbaceous, because galenic is not usually to see for non-professional fields or general cosmetics reader.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	3	1	1	All the corrections are highlighted in red.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	3	1	1	The “galenic” was mentioned in the article due to physician Claudio Galeno, which created the first creams formulations.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	3	1	1	Therefore we decided to change galenic to cosmetic.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	Less a parenthesis at line 132.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	4	2	1	Inserted parenthesis at line 132 (Tpeak = 48.17 °C).
					0	R2
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	At line 160, “Figureure” should be “Figure.”
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	5	3	1	Corrected at line 160 “Figureure” to “Figure”.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	At line 161 mentioned Tonset DCS, but does not explain what this word mean.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	6	4	1	This abbreviation is widely use in Thermal analysis.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	6	4	1	We specified in the text (the extrapolated peak onset temperature (TonsetDSC).
Reviewer_2	Author	1	5	0	2	In Table II, Tonset DCS is a units of temperature, it should be used comma instead of decimal point.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	5	1	We removed the units of temperature from the Table.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	6	0	2	At line 167, “donateis” is typically used to represent donate money, we proposed change to be “provide”, in additional, this sentence is not fluent at grammar.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	8	6	1	We changed “donate” to provide and the other word donor to provider.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	7	0	2	The sentence in line 168 is not fluent at grammar.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	9	7	1	We changed this sentence.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	8	0	2	At line 189, it dors (does) not have sample named EBL, it needs to be check again.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	8	1	The sample´s name corrected (EM/BL) at line 189.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	9	0	2	Integration of all the above problems, this post Journal does not provide future applications of phytic acid in cosmetics and its title is mentioned in herbal lotion but the experiment did not use any herb emulsion formulation.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	9	0	2	For the antioxidant capacity of phytic acid only do the experiment of DPPH that has not more in-depth study.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	9	0	2	Lot of grammatical errors is found in sentences.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	9	0	2	So we suggested to big modifications, then returned for review.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	11	9	1	We integrated all the problems and correct he errors.
					0	Round 1: and Author Response The article titled “Thermal behavior and free-radical-scavenging activity of phytic acid alone and incorporated in galenic emulsions” is focused on the characterization of phytic acid stability and use in cosmetic formulas.
					0	The article is well written, and the overall study was well planned and professionally conducted.
					0	All the experiments shown are necessary and sufficient to support the conclusions.
					0	However, I think that the article can be substantially improved if the following points are addressed: (1)
Reviewer_3	Author	1	1	0	2	The conclusions reported are very short and poor.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	1	0	2	More discussion of the presented results is needed.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_3	2	12	1	1	All the corrections are highlighted in green.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	12	1	1	We expanded the discussion of the results on pages 7, 10 and the conclusion on page 11 (item 4).
					0	(2)
Reviewer_3	Author	1	2	0	2	The authors missed to report other authors’ studies which agree or disagree with their findings.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	2	1	As mentioned in this paper, there are few studies related to the phytic acid in cosmetic products.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	2	1	However we added more references regarding about phytic acid antioxidant activity.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	2	1	References 24, 25 and 26.
					0	R3 (3)
Reviewer_3	Author	1	3	0	2	What is the output of this study?
Reviewer_3	Author	1	3	0	2	What are the implications in the use of PA in galenic/cosmetic formulations?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_3	2	14	3	1	We mentioned in the text more information about incorporation of phytic acid into emulsion on Thermal Analysis results, DPPH results and conclusion.
					0	(4)
Reviewer_3	Author	1	4	0	2	What are the suggestions of the authors about the use of PA in Cosmetics based on their results?
Reviewer_3	Author	1	4	0	2	And what the parameters and the tricks that the formulators should be aware of while using PA in their products?
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	4	1	Regarding with this queries we improved the discussion in the results on page 7.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	15	4	1	But we need to study more about.
					0	Second Round of Evaluation Round 2: and Author Response
Reviewer_2	Author	3	1	0	2	From the experimental results that phytic acid will decrease the thermal stability of the emulsion, but at line 220 mention that phytic acid has the effect of lipid peroxidation and therefore can be added as an anti-oxidant in the emulsion.
Reviewer_2	Author	3	1	0	2	So we recommend authors to describe these two points much clearer.
					0	Response:
Author	Reviewer_2	4	1	1	1	We described these two points more clearly.
Author	Reviewer_2	4	1	1	1	The thermal analysis technique applies high temperatures in the samples due to this thermal stability of the emulsion associated with phytic acid decreased.
