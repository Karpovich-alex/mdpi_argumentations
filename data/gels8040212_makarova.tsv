Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	What equipment was used for the texture profile analysis?
					0	Response 2:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Thanks for your suggestion.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	In this study, texture profile analysis was investigated by a Texture Analyzer (TA.XT PLUS/50, STABLEMICVO, UK) using a P/0.5R cylindrical probe, and corresponding description has been added to the manuscript in Line 526 marked in red font.
					0	Point 3:
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	Describe the emulsion blank gel.
					0	Response 3:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	19	16	1	Thanks for your comment.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	The gel without the emulsion was taken as the emulsion blank gel, which was the gel formed only by gel continuous phase.
					0	Point 4:
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	"What does the term ""wet gel"" mean?"
					0	Response 4:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	18	15	1	Thanks for your question.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Wet gel were the emulsion gels we obtained, which had a three-dimensional network structure that can hold a large amount of water.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	The corresponding Line 570 in the manuscript has been revised to a more accurate expression, emulsion gels.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Thanks again for your careful review.
					0	Author Response Point 1: This article compares the production of emulsion gels by two different methods, namely heat-and TGase- induced emulsion gels.
					0	The article is very well written and only requires few minor changes.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	4	1	This concentration was selected as a suitable emulsifier concentration based on the results in Figure 1a and 1b, and more details can be found in the manuscript.
					0	Point 5:

					0	Point 7:
Reviewer_2	Author	1	6	0	2	Figure 3: rename using latin alphabet
					0	Response 7: Thanks for your carefully check.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	9	6	1	Figure 3 has been revised accordingly.
					0	Point 8:
Reviewer_2	Author	1	7	0	2	Figure 4: Increase legend as it is not visible.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	7	0	2	B1, B2, and B3 looks biphasic, was this the case?
					0	Response 8: Thanks for your comment.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	7	1	Figure 4 has been adjusted to make the legend clear.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	7	1	In fact, B1, B2 and B3 were in a relatively homogeneous state, and no phase separation had occurred.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	7	1	The shadow in the middle part of the apparent image of the heat-induced gels was because the texture test was carried out before shooting.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	7	1	Unlike TGase-induced emulsion gel had very good elastic texture, the structure of heat-induced gels did not fully recover to its original state due to its soft and less elastic texture after compression.
					0	Point 9:
Reviewer_2	Author	1	8	0	2	Figure 7-B: I suggest choosing just one shear rate, instead of providing both graphs one can provide the numerical values at a fixed shear rate.
					0	Response 9:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	11	8	1	Thanks for your constructive suggestion.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	11	8	1	Figure 7B has been revised accordingly, that is, a graph was added which displayed the apparent viscosity of all emulsion gels at a fixed shear rate of 0.25/s, showing the differences between groups very visually.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	11	8	1	Thanks again for your suggestion.
					0	Point 10:
Reviewer_2	Author	1	9	0	2	Line 474: What is meant by optimize condition?
					0	Response 10: Thanks for your question.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	12	9	1	In order to choose appropriate emulsifier, we prepare different WPI concentration of 1.0-2.0 wt% and found the emulsion formulated with 1.5 wt% WPI had smaller size and medimum zeta potential, so it was described to the optimize condition.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	12	9	1	For clarity, we have also revised the corresponding positions in the manuscript.
					0	Point 11:
Reviewer_2	Author	1	10	0	2	Line 478 and 485: Are the gel continuous phase and the protein-emulsion mixture the same thing?
Reviewer_2	Author	1	10	0	2	This section is a bit confusing so I would suggest authors include a Table with all the sample formulations/conditions tested.
					0	Response 11:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	10	1	Thanks for your good suggestion.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	10	1	The gel continuous phase was the WPI-gelatin mixture.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	10	1	To more clearly describe the composition of the emulsion gel, Table 3 has been added to the manuscript.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	10	1	The pre-gel mixture, refered to the mixture before gelation occurred, was composed of WPI-gelatin mixture and emulsions, but due to the large number of samples prepared by the single factor experiment, only the general formulation of the emulsion gel was listed in Table 3.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	10	1	And the relevant statements in 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 have been revised in the manuscript.

					0	Response 13:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	15	12	1	Thanks for your carefully review.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	15	12	1	The characterization of emulsions was investigated by the droplet size, polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	15	12	1	This expression has been revised in the manuscript.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	15	12	1	Point 14: Line 500: Define PDI at first use
