					0	Author Response Dear Professor Mok, We appreciate that you give us the possibility to revise our manuscript and we thank the reviewers for their valuable comments.
					0	Based on these comments we herewith respond to all questions raised in a point-by-point manner, as follows: Reviewer 1:
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	Based on the cell line RNA and protein data the expression level of MACC1 is highly variable rather than being present or not.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	Is there a similar variability present among the tissue samples?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	Please provide the distribution of the IRS scores of the patient cohort and explain how was IRS 5 chosen as cut off?
					0	Answer:
Author	Reviewer_1	4	1	1	2	We thank the reviewer for this comment.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	As suggested, we analyzed the distribution of IRS (immunoreactivity score) across the cohort.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	In Figure 1 it can be clearly seen that there are two groups forming here, those with 0-4 and those with 6-12 IRS.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	In addition, we calculated the survival probability depending on the IRS (Figure 2).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Patients with an IRS of 6 or higher have a similar bad prognosis compared to patients with an IRS below 5.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	A better survival correlates with lower MACC1 IRS.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Patients with an IRS of 0 have the best prognosis.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Based on these two analyses, the decision for cut-off value of 5 was made.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Additionally, ROC curve analysis showed, that the IRS value of 5 has the highest Youden Index and is therefore the most suitable cut-off value.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	1	1	2	The IRS cut-off value 5 reaches a sensitivity of 76.6% and a specificity of 64.2% (Youden Index.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	0.408) (Figure 3 and Table 1).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Looking at MACC1 expression in cell lines and tissue samples, the variability looks similar.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Nevertheless, it must be considered that the investigation of the homogeneous cell lines is a purely quantitative analysis of the expression by Western plot and RT-PCR.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	The analysis of the tissue samples by immunoreactivity score analyses both the strength of expression and the inhomogeneity of expression.

Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	The authors argue that MACC1 expression did not significantly influenced cell proliferation in the two cell line models.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	However, cell proliferation was analyzed only in a 24-hour long period even though most cancer cells have a doubling time around 24 hours.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	In order to draw a conclusion about the proliferation effect a longer (48 or 72 hours) measurement is necessary.
					0	Answer:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	We thank the reviewer for raising this point.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	However, to respond to this question appropriately, we currently can provide only the results from proliferation assays for one cell line model (FLO1-EV vs FLO1-MACC1) over the time period of 72 h. This assay was with no statistically significant difference in cell proliferation between FLO1-EV vs FLO1-MACC1 (see Figure 4).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Figure 4: Proliferation of FLO1 EV and FLO1 MACC1 over 72 h. Analysis of in vitro proliferation assay.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Unfortunately, the short revision period of 10 days limits the generation of additional data sets for proliferation in further tumor cell lines.
					0	The concentration used from selumetinib both for the cell line experiments (10 microM) and for the animal experiments (50 mg/kg) are quite high.
					0	Please discuss how the applied concentrations are related to the clinically used dosage (75 mg administered orally twice https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02448290) and why not the more efficient MEK1 inhibitor trametinib was used for the experiments.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	It would be nice to know the selumetinib sensitivity of the two used cell lines.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	We thank the reviewer for this question.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	The concept of MACC1 inhibition was originally developed by our group for the treatment of MACC1 positive colorectal cancers and was recently published (Kobelt et al.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Oncogene 2021).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	In this study we transferred our experience with MACC1 inhibition by selumetinib on AGE/S.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Therefore, we chose the same doses for in vitro and in vivo experiments, and which was also used by other authors (Huynh et al.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Mol Cancer Therapy.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	2007).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Further, we knew that the selected selumetinib concentrations of 10 µM has no cytotoxic effect in vitro and showed no reduction of migration in the MACC1 negative clones (FLO1-EV and OEshMACC1).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Regarding the different dosages in the context of xenografted mice treatment in vivo and the clinically used dosages, the FDA recommends multiplying the dosage by a factor of 0.08 when transferring from mouse to human (Niar et al.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Journal of basic and clinical pharmacy 2016).
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	According to this calculation, the dosage of 50 mg selumetinib /kg mouse used would equal a dosage of 4 mg/kg in humans.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	The clinical dose of 75mg twice daily corresponds to a dose of 2x1mg per kg assuming a patient weight of 75kg.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Using the aforementioned calculation, this dose equals then 12.5 mg/kg for treatment of mice.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	In our study, we refer again to the work of Huynh et al.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Here, in which a dosage of 12 mg/kg selumetinib showed only a low level of effectiveness.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	At 100 mg/kg, a very good effectiveness was seen, however combined with an increased toxicity.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Thus, we used in our study the dosage of 50 mg/kg as an effective dosage with low toxicity for the mice.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Overall, we are considering here a pre-clinical model.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	The possibility of MEK1 inhibition to inhibit MACC1-induced effects in AGE/S was examined.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	Further, extended in vivo studies might then reveal the ideal dosage in vivo, being thereafter translated to use in humans.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	The use of trametinib is an interesting suggestion and might well be adapted to its use in forthcoming studies References: Kobelt, D., Perez-Hernandez, D., Fleuter, C., Dahlmann, M., Zincke, F., Smith, J., ... & Stein, U.

Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	[1] Figure 4 is missing.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	In the pdf I reviewed, the caption is there, but the figure is not.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	4	1	1	We apologize for the inconvenience.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	4	1	1	Figure 4 can be found on page 14 in the submitted version.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	4	1	1	We inserted Figure 4 in the revised manuscript again to solve the technical issue.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	[2] Abstract says 266 patients were analyzed (line 36), while result says 360 patients were analyzed (line 249).
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	Please fix this inconsistency.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	5	2	1	We address this question in the results part MACC1 expression: “ Due to the procedure of cutting and staining, some samples could not be used for the evaluation.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	5	2	1	Samples with insufficiently representative tumor tissue were also excluded from the evaluation.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	5	2	1	Cores with representative tumor material and evaluable staining were available in 266 of 360 samples (73.9%)…”.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	5	2	1	To avoid misunderstandings, we corrected the abstract to: 266 Samples of 360 AGE/S patients were analyzed for MACC1 expression.

Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	[4] In Figures 3G and 3H, please specify p-values for untreated vs selumetinib in FLO-1/EV and OE33/shMACC1 respectively.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	If the difference is statistically significant, please briefly explain/speculate why.
					0	Answer:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	4	1	We thank the reviewer for this valuable hint.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	4	1	As suggested, we included p-values in Figure 3G and 3H.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	4	1	In Figure 3G there is a significant increase in migration of cells without MACC1 expression.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	4	1	This is based on a sufficiently large N, that renders even small differences statistically significant.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	4	1	Further, this increase is rather small and is outperformed by the MACC1-mediated increase in migration and the reduction in the MACC1-mediated migration by selumetinib.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	7	4	1	The data show, that selumetinib does not reduce migration of the MACC1-negative FLO1 and that MACC1 induces migration in this cell line that can be inhibited by selumetinib.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	5	0	2	[5] If possible, please use a higher resolution version of Figures 3F and 3I (the legends are blurry and hard to read in the current version).

Author	Reviewer_2	2	8	5	1	We thank the reviewer for this suggestion to improve the visual quality of the manuscript.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	8	5	1	The legends of 3F and I have been enlarged and the resolution of the figure has been increased.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	6	0	2	[6] In line 306/307, please explain/speculate briefly why the control clone had higher MACC1 expression than the wildtype.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	9	6	1	We thank the reviewer for this discussion.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	9	6	1	The empty vector control clone was transduced and selected afterwards.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	9	6	1	During the selection procedure it is possible that a subclone was generated that expresses slightly more (or less) of any mRNA and protein.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	9	6	1	It differs from the wildtype by handling (transduction, selection etc) and somewhat by age (cell divisions).
Author	Reviewer_2	2	9	6	1	Therefore, for all comparisons the empty vector clone was used, as this clone was generated in parallel to the MACC1 clone.
