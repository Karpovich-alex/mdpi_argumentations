Reviewer_1	Author	1	7	0	2	It would be added value if these NH···O hydrogen bonds were also investigated in the solid state using XRD analysis.
					0	RESPONSE:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	We appreciate the suggestion.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	7	7	1	However, we do not think we have time to perform a proper analysis of XRD data, considering solid state effects, crystal packing, etc.

Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	Something has happened during the editorial procedure when changing to Palatino Linotype.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	Not all reference numbers were changed correctly.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	8	8	1	We have tried to find and correct the errors.
					0	Author Response Reviewer 2In this article, the authors describe the spectral characteristics of NH in the hydrogen bridge NH...O.
					0	It is a continuation of similar OH...O binding studies performed 10 years ago.
					0	The rationale for undertaking the research is a bit puzzling.
					0	I am curious what prompted the Authors to deal with N-H...O bonding in place of the earlier O-H...O.
					0	The explanation should be cleared.
					0	RESPONSE: The background for the investigation is described in the Introduction section.
					0	As indicated by the Reviewer, the present study is an extension of our previous OH···O binding studies.
					0	We have for some time wished to investigate the corresponding NH···O systems.
					0	The NH···O type of linkage has the advantage that a wide range of compounds can be investigated; in general, systems of the type NH···O=C with an intervening double bond are not tautomeric, in contrast to the corresponding OH···O=C systems.
					0	We have added a remark on this aspect to the Introduction section.
					0	- The ‘delay’ of 10 years is due to technical and personal factors of no relevance to the reported results.
					0	Anyway, I think the article has some educational significance and could be published after few major and minor points are taken into account: Major:
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	1) The authors should give the reason for the nonlinear v(NH) vs delta correlation as it was (according to Dudek) linear for OH-O.
					0	RESPONSE:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	9	1	1	We are aware of the controversial nature of this result.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	9	1	1	We also expected a linear relationship similar to the one observed by Dudek.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	9	1	1	However, we have in this work extended the range of compounds to include species of types J, K, and L, apparently resulting in the observed non-linear relationship.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	9	1	1	The correlation in Fig.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	9	1	1	2 involves only experimental values, most of them from the literature, and we have no reason to doubt their reliability.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	9	1	1	The exponential regression yields R2 = 0.975, SD = 34.3 cm–1, while the corresponding linear regression gives R2 = 0.837, SD = 93.3 cm–1.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	9	1	1	Hence, the indication of a non-linear correlation is evident.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	9	1	1	"We have added the sentence ""Probably the extension of the range of compounds to include species of the types J, K, and L has led to the non-linear correlation” to the first paragraph on page 13."
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	2) Performing calculations with the Grimme dispersion correction did not make sense here, as D3 is important for intermolecular interactions, especially stacking.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	Here, calculations are performed for isolated molecules.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	Rather, the author could check B3PW91 (it often performs better than B3LYP) or any newer suitable functional.
					0	RESPONSE:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	2	1	Our attention was drawn to Ref.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	2	1	[54] where Grimme et al.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	2	1	"state that ""The [DFT-D3] method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions""."
Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	2	1	"We thus found it relevant to try out B3LYP-D3 for the present study of ""intramolecular noncovalent interactions""."
Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	2	1	"But the Reviewer finds that these calculations ""make no sense here"", so we have removed these results from the manuscript."
Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	2	1	The Reviewer suggests that we check the functional B3PW91 (in the Introduction we actually mention B3PW91 as one of the two functionals recommended by Scott and Radom).
Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	2	1	We have performed additional B3PW91/6-311++G(d,p) calculations on a series of seven compounds covering a wide range of NH stretching wavenumbers.
Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	2	1	The computed harmonic wavenumbers are essentially linearly related to those obtained with B3LYP (R2 = 0.9999, SD = 2.6 cm–1).
Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	2	1	We have added a remark on this result to the last paragraph of Section 3.2.
					0	Minor:
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	183: should be SD = 34.3 cm-1
					0	RESPONSE:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	11	3	1	Corrected!
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	"186: ""are reasonable"": Taking into account that (i) this fit is rather unphysical (ii) moving the points by say 50 cm-1 one way or the other would also give rather good fit, this phrase is rather an empty cliche."
					0	RESPONSE:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	12	4	1	"The sentence with ""are reasonable"" has been removed."
Reviewer_2	Author	1	5	0	2	Figure 5: Why is the y-axis reversed?
					0	RESPONSE:
Author	Reviewer_2	2	13	5	1	The orientation of the axes was chosen according to the trend reported by Novak [56]: Decreasing NH stretching wavenumber corresponds to decreasing isotope ratio.
					0	Author Response Reviewer 1: Comments and Suggestions for Authors1.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	1	0	2	In the experimental section of the 13C NMR it should be 125 MHz instead of 126 MHz.2.
Reviewer_1	Author	3	2	0	2	Correct subscripts and superscripts in the experimental also check the spacings to be consistent.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	2	2	2	This concerns the experimental section, S21, in the Supplementary Material document.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	2	2	2	We have scrutinized the text and corrected the errors.
Author	Reviewer_1	4	2	2	2	We have also corrected two typos in the main manuscript.
