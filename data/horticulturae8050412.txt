Major corrections The manuscript by Zhu et al., describes the cloning of OfSPL1 transcriptional activator from Osmanthus fragans, its molecular characterization, subcellular localization, gene-expression, trans-activation in tobacco cells and two-hybrid system, and overexpression in Arabidopsis, displaying and enhanced salt-tolerance phenotype and protection from oxidative damage.
In addition, heterologous overexpression promotes induction of several genes involved in tolerance to abiotic stress.
Although the work is thorough, the Discussion is insufficient.
Also, the manuscript is poorly written, it should be substantially improved.

The paper by Zhu and coworkers deal with the functional deeeping on te role of gene OfSPL11 from Osmanthus fragrant.
This goal was achieved using transgenic lines to investigate the role of this gene in salt stress response.
A deeeping on protein an nucleotide structures was also reported.
Results clearly describe the protein localization as well as its role in stress response.
In this view, I've only some few questions for the authors.Why the authors do not consider to use aminoacidic sequence to compute a protein model (e.g., by using gromacs)?Auhtors report that Actin was used as housekeeping gene.
Do the authors have performed an efficiency test before using it?
Do they tried to use otherHK genes?
Furthermore, I reccomend a text revision since some errors are present in the main text.

Response to Reviewer 1 Comments Point 1: "back of tobacco" is not clear be more specific.
Response 1: Thank for your kindly suggestion.
We feel sorry for the unclear statement.
We have modified this part in revised manuscript (Line 233-236).
This sentence has been changed to “A suspension of A. rhizogenes strain GV3101 containing the pORER4-OfSPL11-GFP recombinant plasmid was aspirated using a 1 mL range syringe (needle not included), and the suspension was gently injected into the abaxial surface of four-week-old tobacco leaves avoiding the leaf veins.” Point 2: Rephrase lines 266-268 is unclear; wording, grammar and punctuation are wrong.
Response 2: Special thanks to you for your good suggestion.
We have revised the manuscript according to your comments (Line 274-277).

tumefaciens suspensions containing the fusion vector OfSPL11pro: LUC was transiently transformed into O. fragrans callus using vacuum infiltration, and then the O. fragrans callus were cultured in a symbiotic medium containing 0 mM and 200 mM NaCl.” Point 3: Rephrase lines 317-318.
Comments as above.
Response 3: Thank you for your comment.
We have modified this part in revised manuscript (Line 326-328).
This sentence has been changed to “To better understand why OfSPL11 transgenic lines exhibit enhanced abiotic stress tolerance, we analyzed the expression of known abiotic stress response genes in 3-week-old wild-type and transgenic Arabidopsis.” Point 4: In lines 271-272 and 395-396, how do you explain that salt induced promoter trans-activation?
Is there any published precedent?
Response 4: We feel sorry for the unclear statement.
In a previous study (Ding, 2021), the LlWRKY39 promoter was fused to a pGreenII-0800-LUC vector using a recombinant ligase (Vazyme, Nanjing, China).
The constructed vector and an empty vector (control) were transformed into A. tumefaciens strain GV3101 (pSoup), which was used to transform N. benthamiana leaves.
The LUC signal increased profoundly after subjection to HS (37℃), although under normal conditions (room temperature), the LUC signal was very low, which implied that HS activated the promoter activity of LlWRKY39.
In this study, the experimental operations, reagents and plant materials were were the same as the previous study, except for the different treatment conditions.
Therefore, we suggest that salt stress can induce the activity of the OfSPL11 promoter.

Response to Reviewer 2 Comments Point 1: Why the authors do not consider to use aminoacidic sequence to compute a protein model (e.g., by using gromacs)?
Response 1: Thank you for your comment.
We feel sorry for the unclear statement.
In our study, we used the amino acid sequence of OfSPL11 to compute the protein model.
Secondary structure predictions were conducted on the PRABI (http://www.prabi.fr/spip.php?page=sommaire) protein structure prediction server.
The ExPASy (http://web.expasy.org) was used to analyze the molecular weight, theoretical isoelectric point, and other physiochemical properties of the translated protein.
Similar methods of operation and efforts can be found in other articles (Islam, 2021).
Once again,we sincerely thank you for the recommended method, which we will use in future studies.

Do the authors have performed an efficiency test before using it?
Do they tried to use otherHK genes?
Response 2: Thank you for your comment.
We tested the amplification efficiency before using housekeeping genes.
Referring to the previous study of Arabidopsis housekeeping genes (Dheda, 2004; Czechowski, 2005; Hou, 2018), we selected Atactin1 (F: AGGCACCTCTTAACCCTAAAGC, R: GGACAACGGAATCTCTCAGC), Atactin2 (F: TTGTGCTGGATTCTGGTGATGG, R: CCGCTCTCTGCTGTTGTGGTG) and Atactin8 (F: GAATTACCCGACGGACA, R: ACGGTCTGCAATACCT) were tested for efficiency, and we found that the best result was Atactin2.
The best housekeeping gene for O. fragrans is OfACT, which has been reported in a previous study (Zhang, 2015).
