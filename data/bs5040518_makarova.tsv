Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	This is a well-written paper with a large sample of girls that replicates and extends important research on relational aggression.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	The focus on the functions (reactive and proactive) of relational aggression has significant implications for intervention with adolescent girls.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	1	0	2	I commend the authors for this timely and crucial study on factors that influence the development of aggression and antisocial behavior in girls, which is typically an understudied topic.
					0	Round 1: Author Response to Reviewer 1
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Thank you for the enthusiastic comments.
					0	Round 1: and Author Response This manuscript reports on person-centered analysis of adolescent girls finding that they are distinguished by types of aggression, callous-unemotional traits, and by interpersonal relationships with peers and parents.
					0	The study is consistent with other recently published work in this area in identifying subgroups that are characterized by their severity of aggression.
					0	These findings are in contrast to earlier work, which assumed that proactive and reactive aggression represented distinct typologies.
					0	This work, as with other recent work, makes clear that the most severely aggressive youth tend to engage in high R2 levels of both proactive and reactive aggression and are otherwise also generally more distressed and dysregulated, as compared with youth who are more moderately aggressive and tend to engage in reactive aggression only, and youth who have low levels of aggression.
					0	The study is strengthened by the person-centered approach to data analysis, by the large sample, by focusing on girls who have been much less studied than boys, and by the clear rationale for the study.
					0	In my view, this manuscript will make a nice contribution to the literature.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	There are two areas to address to strengthen the paper a bit more.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	First, it is recommended that the authors provide more information about the selection of the cluster solution.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	That is, no information is available in the present manuscript about alternative cluster solutions from the analysis, for example, the extent to which BIC and the silhouette coefficient differed for other solutions and so forth.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	It would help the reader to have some information available as a way of arguing more strongly that the accepted solution (which does make theoretical and empirical sense) is the strongest grouping.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	Second, the manuscript should be carefully edited as there are a fair number of grammatical and typographical errors, including lack of subject-verb agreement in places (e.g., using “were” and “was” in the same sentence, both referring to the same measure - CU traits), omitted words, and so forth.
					0	Overall, this is a nice paper that looks to make a contribution.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	5	3	1	Thank you!
Author	Reviewer_2	2	5	3	1	I have now carefully read and edited the paper.
					0	Round 1: and Author Response The goal of this study was to distinguish subgroups of relationally aggressive females (i.e., reactively aggressive-only subgroup, reactively-and-proactively aggressive-combined subgroup, non-aggressive subgroup), on the basis of nine factors reflecting individual characteristics, peer-related variables and R3 parental control.
					0	Despite the use of a relatively large sample and of sound measures, this study falls short of making an important contribution to the current literature for several reasons.
					0	1.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	1	0	2	Although the rationale for selecting each of the 9 factors that might be differentially related to reactive or proactive relational aggression is convincing, the overall picture is incomplete on at least two accounts.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	2	0	2	First, some factors (i.e., CU traits) may be predictors whereas others (i.e., delinquency) may be correlates or consequences of relational aggression.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	2	0	2	If the authors are really interested in the processes that could feed into reactive or proactive relational aggression in females, they should have been more attentive to this issue.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	3	0	2	Second, the authors do not mention why they implicitly selected an additive model (i.e., each factor makes a unique and independent contribution) instead of, for example, an interactional model (i.e., peer and parent factors potentiate the link between individual factors and subtypes of relational aggression).
					0	2.
					0	The use of a cross-sectional design is a major limitation, because it cannot help determine the directionality of the links between the nine factors and subtypes of relational aggression, left alone causality.
					0	This bears directly on the issue of predictors vs. correlates vs. consequences of subtypes of relational aggression.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	4	0	2	Given the severe limitations of their cross-sectional design, the authors need to revise their comments with respect to directionality and their use of causality terms throughout the manuscript.
					0	3.
					0	All the measures are self-reported.
					0	This artificially inflates the link between the study variables.
					0	Acknowledging this problem in the limitations does not solve it.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	5	0	2	Some measures such as self-reports of peers’ delinquency are also flawed because of a possible projection bias.
					0	4.
					0	Creating groups based on a cluster analysis may have created unnecessary problems.
					0	In particular, and contrary to what the authors seem to believe, it is not possible to know whether differences between the two aggressive groups reflect differences in levels of relational aggression or in type of relational aggression (reactive only vs. combined), given that the combined group is obviously much more aggressive than the reactive-only group.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	6	0	2	A better strategy would have been to predict each type of aggression while controlling its overlap with the other type (i.e., include reactive aggression when predicting proactive aggression and vice-versa).
					0	5.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	7	0	2	Some findings are difficult to reconcile with the current literature; in addition, they are internally inconsistent.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	7	0	2	For example, how to explain that the combined group is not more delinquent than the reactively aggressive group although they report more CU traits and more delinquent peers, two known factors in regard to delinquent behaviors?
					0	6.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	8	0	2	There are a number of grammatical and lexical problems throughout the manuscript that need to be taken care of.
					0	Round 1: Author Response to Reviewer 3 First, some factors (i.e., CU traits) may be predictors whereas others (i.e., delinquency) may be correlates or consequences of relational aggression.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	7	2	1	True that we do not know the direction of effects.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	7	2	1	Here, we use predictor in the statistical sense not causal sense.
					0	Second, the authors do not mention why they implicitly selected an additive model (i.e., each factor makes a unique and independent contribution) instead of, for example, an interactional model.
					0	R4
Author	Reviewer_3	2	9	3	1	We agree this would be useful but it was not our aim to look at interactions.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	9	3	1	We also believe interactions such as suggested are better done in longitudinal studies where one can examine moderators.
					0	Given the severe limitations of their cross-sectional design, the authors need to revise their comments with respect to directionality and their use of causality terms throughout the manuscript.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	10	4	1	We have attempted to be mindful of causal language and only use it where prior research indicates a direction.
					0	Some measures such as self-reports of peers’ delinquency are also flawed because of a possible projection bias.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	11	5	1	We agree this is a major flaw and we thank the reviewer for pointing out projection bias.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	11	5	1	We now include this in the limitations in the discussion.
					0	A better strategy would have been to predict each type of aggression while controlling its overlap with the other type (i.e., include reactive aggression when predicting proactive aggression and vice-versa).
Author	Reviewer_3	2	12	6	1	We agree with the reviewer that there is no easy answer to this problem.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	12	6	1	We now include a discussion of this in the introduction and cite Lynam and colleagues on this exact dilemma.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	12	6	1	In their paper, they discuss the Perils of Partialing (p.4, line 15), which is what you do when you control for the overlap.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	12	6	1	That is, one may be removing the reliable aspect of the self-report measures of aggression (when they are highly correlated) and remaining with residual error.
					0	For example, how to explain that the combined group is not more delinquent than the reactively aggressive group although they report more CU traits and more delinquent peers, two known factors in regard to delinquent behaviors?
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	7	1	The reactive aggressive group did not differ from the combined group on peer delinquency.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	7	1	Thus, both were high on delinquency and peer delinquency.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	13	7	1	Also, we comment on the overlap between peer delinquency and self-report of delinquency in the results section (p.9, line 14).
					0	There are a number of grammatical and lexical problems throughout the manuscript that need to be taken care of.
Author	Reviewer_3	2	14	8	1	We have carefully edited the paper.
					0	Round 1: and Author Response Interesting paper!!
					0	Below are a few comments that could hopefully help improve a solid piece of work.
					0	1.
Reviewer_4	Author	1	1	0	2	The first two sentences of the abstract throw quite a bit of information at the reader, particularly as in the third sentence, it does not appear that all types of aggression will be assessed in the manuscript, but other constructs are introduced (contextual factors).
Reviewer_4	Author	1	1	0	2	Then, when the authors state the objectives of the study (in next sentence) CU, delinquency and peer influence is introduced.
					0	R5 a.
Reviewer_4	Author	1	2	0	2	Could the authors simplify the abstract?
Reviewer_4	Author	1	2	0	2	Is there a cohesive narrative that could bind the different constructs together?
					0	b.
Reviewer_4	Author	1	3	0	2	As it is, this reviewer had difficulty following the variables as predictors/outcomes and the hypotheses that are driving the paper 2.
Reviewer_4	Author	1	4	0	2	There are enough variables that I hard a hard time following the analyses.
Reviewer_4	Author	1	4	0	2	A tighter focus in the intro and matching of analyses to hypotheses may help here.
					0	Round 1: Author Response to Reviewer 4
Author	Reviewer_4	2	18	4	1	The manuscript has been edited for grammar problems and for clarity.
Author	Reviewer_4	2	18	4	1	We have also added Table 1 to assist with understanding our predictors and the broader factors they represent in this study.
					0	Second Round of Evaluation Round 2:
Reviewer_4	Author	3	1	0	2	I think the paper is improved.
Reviewer_4	Author	3	1	0	2	But I do not feel that the authors responded in great detail to my comments.
