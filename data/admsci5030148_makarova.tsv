					0	Round 1: Author Response to Reviewer 1 I copied and pasted the reviewer commentary, below.
					0	I respond, in-line, in bold.
					0	This paper communicated a nice research idea, but I find it too superficial in its approach.
					0	The two major issues are: - the third sector, its definition and description is missing.
					0	I would not have thought of this as a major issue unless Evers and Laville (2004) The third sector in Europe, Edward Elgar, spesifically discuss whether cooperations are defined within or outside the third sector.

					0	The least we should expect is a definition.
					0	Agree that it should not be an issue.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	Therefore, I recalibrated the piece to note that co-operatives are not third sector organizations, but instead have similar features that could allow the institutional analyst fertile ground for innovations in governance.
					0	- the case description and analysis is based only on media accounts - no actual first hand information to inform the analysis.
					0	I find this less than satisfying.
					0	It should be possible to interview a few key individuals about the case to make sure the medis picture is corrected where this is needed.

					0	Your choices may be OK in given circumstances, but how do you argue for these choices here?
					0	This is unclear in the paper - a methodology chapter/discussion is needed.
					0	I agree that this is not a case study; I made the mistake in haste.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	I have therefore changed the paper from a case study to a discussion paper.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Additionally, I note in the paper that I perform an archival analysis of media accounts in an effort to demonstrate how the utilization of the ODPs for analysizing secondary data may better position the analyst to perform rigorous, interogative fieldwork.

					0	Round 1: and Author Response 1.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	The abstract of the manuscript mentions that dominant modes of third sector organizational governance adhere to a narrow principal-agent orientation.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	1	0	2	Similarly, in the introduction, it is stated that governance research on third sector organizations predominantly fixates analysts on the board-management dynamic.
					0	I do not agree with the author for several reasons.
					0	First, the principal-agent approach is only one of theoretical perspectives used to analyze nonprofit governance (Cornforth, 2004; Renz and Andersson, 2014).
					0	Second, the board-manager relationship is only a small part of the research on nonprofit boards, which in turn is the major focus of nonprofit governance research (Cornforth, 2012; Renz and Andersson, 2014).
					0	Furthermore, there is no discussion of principal-agent literature in a third sector context (see, for example, Jegers, 2009), which is quite surprising since the proposition to go beyond the traditional principal-agent literature is one of the main ideas of the manuscript.
					0	2.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	In the abstract, the author also states that the over-reliance on the principal-agent model introduces two challenges.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	2	0	2	However, a solid foundation for this argument is missing.
					0	The disadvantages of a too narrow principal-agent approach have been acknowledged in previous studies (Miller, 2002).
					0	Furthermore, attempts have already been made to broaden the principal-agent approach in nonprofit organizations (Ben-Ner et al., 2012; Van Puyvelde et al., 2012, Coule, 2015), leading me to the question what this manuscript actually adds to the literature.
					0	3.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	In the introduction, the author also mentions underdeveloped modes of stakeholder governance in the third sector.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	I do not agree with this view.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	3	0	2	Several stakeholder governance frameworks for third sector organizations have already been developed in the literature (Young, 2011; Van Puyvelde et al., 2012; Wellens and Jegers, 2014).
					0	4.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	4	0	2	The author uses “stakeholder-controlled firm”, “third sector organizations”, “nonprofit organizations”, “social enterprise”, and “co-operative” without clearly defining these types and mentioning which nonprofit type is actually the focus of the study.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	5	0	2	I am also not convinced by the definition of co-operatives mentioned in the paper.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	6	0	2	Furthermore, given that the world of third sector organizations is very rich and heterogeneous, one should be careful by discussing third sector organizations in general, especially since the case study seems to focus on co-operative enterprises.
					0	Instead of being vague and using a mixed terminology, the manuscript should clearly distinguish which nonprofit type is the subject of the paper, and be very careful in generalizing the findings of this study to third sector governance, which mistakenly happens in the conclusion (p. 15).
					0	Given the case study, I would focus on the governance of co-operatives (Cornforth, 2004).
					0	5.
Reviewer_2	Author	1	7	0	2	The literature review is completely missing.
					0	The author only focuses on the application of Ostrom design principles to nonprofit governance, thereby neglecting the solid theoretical foundation that is absolutely necessary to build a more extensive governance framework for third sector organizations.
					0	Cornforth (2004) has already analyzed the governance of co-operatives from multiple theoretical R5 perspectives.
					0	In addition, the developed model (Figure 1) is not new.
					0	It is very similar to the nonprofit governance model of Van Puyvelde et al.
					0	(2012) and the idea that is necessary to capture the broader stakeholder environment in a democratic way is also not new (Coule, 2015).
Reviewer_2	Author	1	8	0	2	Given the aforementioned comments, I would advise the author to revise the paper by focusing on the governance of nonprofit associations / co-operatives.
					0	I believe that Cornforth’s paper (2004) might be a good starting point.
					0	In addition, a more extensive literature review and comparison with previous principal-agent literature and stakeholder governance models (especially Van Puyvelde et al., 2012 and Coule, 2015) may give the manuscript a more solid theoretical foundation.
					0	As such, applying the idea of the Ostrom design principles to nonprofit governance and illustrating this with a case study may more clearly show the contribution of the manuscript to the current literature.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	10	1	1	I agree with your points about the over-emphasis on principle-agent types of governance arrangements.
					0	The Cornforth (2004) article reoriented my thinking (thank you).
					0	"I recognized that it was not ""P-A"" I was critiquing, but the unitarist tradition."
					0	That approach helped with definitional rigor 2.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	14	5	1	The definition used is from the official representative body, the International Co-operative Alliance.

Author	Reviewer_2	2	17	8	1	As per your suggestions, I did focus on the co-operative model I believe that Cornforth’s paper (2004) might be a good starting point.

					0	Round 1: and Author Response The basic premise of this article is good: the application of Ostrom's design principles as a way of analysing / evaluating governance in third sector organisations is quite innovative, particularly combined with a discussion of third sector / cooperative governance principles.
					0	The writing is good, there is a sound development of the theory, and some well drawn conclusions.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	1	0	2	However, there are subtleties in the literature that need considering, and also the methodology (which is extremely weak).
					0	LITERATURE
Reviewer_3	Author	1	2	0	2	The characterisation of third sector governance is too crude.
					0	For example, the third sector itself can be seen as diverse with philanthropic, mutual, cooperative and association sub-sectors.
					0	The comments at the start of the literature review might apply to foundations and charities, but are less true of association and mutuals (let alone cooperatives).
					0	Also, where there are accounting regulations (like SORP), there are mechanism that keep associations and charities accountable to their donors.
					0	To address these subtlies see: Turnbull (2002) A New Way to Govern Cornforth (2004) The Governance of Associations and Mutuals: A Paradox Perspective Ridley-Duff (2007) Communitarian Perspectives on Social Enterprise
Reviewer_3	Author	1	3	0	2	Given the inclusion of Coule's paper, I would have already expected more sensitivity to divisions unitary and pluralist theories of governance but by reviting this (and reading Turnbull's Cornforth's and Ridley-Duff's precursor to Coule's work), this should be adequately addressed.
					0	Secondly,
Reviewer_3	Author	1	4	0	2	I just can't agree that third sector governance is derived from for-profit principles.
					0	It is - mostly - derived from philanthropic principles (or mutual principles inside the social economy).
					0	There is, however, some common practices, but not for the reasons described.
					0	Just as the wealthy entrepreneur seeks to control the private enterprise through shareholdings, so the wealthy philanthropist seeks to control the non-profit enterprise through trust law.
					0	In both cases, Principle-Agent assumptions apply, but not because both are based on for-profit assumptions.
					0	These apply in both cases because funding is sought from wealthy providers with the power to frame laws that require their investees to use the money for the purposes stimpulated by them.
					0	Associations, mutuals and cooperatives, however, are not dependent on the patronage of the rich, but the patronage of the many, and their mass member legal R9 structures and accountability mechanisms reflect this.
					0	In the social economy (associations, mutuals and cooperatives) the legal structures and accountabilities are different (and are captured well in the paper).
					0	METHODOLOGY This is weak, perhaps too weak for an academic paper.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	5	0	2	Certainly, some description of the process by which the case study was developed (sources used, data collection techniquies, analysis techniques) are needed to be publishable.
					0	The use of media sources, while not ideal, might be adequate if the author(s) can show systematic and comprehensive collection of them.
					0	However, the credibility of the paper and findings would be enormously enhanced is some primary interview data could be collected and presented.
					0	Is there a way to interview members who participated in action (or access sources written by them)?
					0	ANALYSIS
Reviewer_3	Author	1	6	0	2	The framework for this section exists but feels a bit superficial and under-developed.
Reviewer_3	Author	1	6	0	2	I think it needs linking back to the findings more clearly and to be elaborated and slightly more length (cut some literature if needed to stay within the word length limits).
					0	THEORISATION
Reviewer_3	Author	1	7	0	2	Lastly, the discussion and conclusions need to stick to contributions to theory / research practice and refrain from commenting on wider issues without adequate justification.
					0	Stick to commenting on the usefulness and value of ODPs, and draw out any theoretical contributions regarding the design principles themselves, or their value as a theoretical perspective for governance research.
