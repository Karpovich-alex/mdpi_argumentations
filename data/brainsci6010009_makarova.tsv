					0	Response to comment:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	1	1	1	In the revised manuscript, this was corrected as suggested.
					0	Comment 2.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	In the exposed and control groups were there other related diseases such as Autism?
Reviewer_1	Author	1	2	0	2	If so, how many and what would happen to the analysis if you removed them?
					0	Response to comment:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Both cases and controls could have been diagnosed with autism, but it should have been a relative minority.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	Autism is relatively rare compared to a 314 diagnosis.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	This issue was added to the study limitations in the revised manuscript.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	“In the present study, neurodevelopmental diagnoses other than 314.xx were not examined among cases and controls.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	2	2	1	This limitation of the present study should have had a limited impact on the results observed because of the rarity of other neurodevelopmental diagnoses as compared to a 314.xx diagnosis, but future studies could further evaluate this phenomenon.” Comment 3.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	On page 3 line 22, they describe children with the diagnosis before the exposure.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	3	0	2	How many were there that fit in this category?
					0	Response to comment:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	3	3	1	We don’t have the exact number, but it is assumed to be a relatively small number.
					0	Comment 4.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	On page 11 line 4 you say levels of Hg in the environment and in humans are increasing but your reference #26 doesn't speak to that point.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	4	0	2	Are there better references to substantiate this point?
					0	Response to comment:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	4	4	1	In the revised manuscript, this was corrected with a better reference.
					0	Comment 5.
Reviewer_1	Author	1	5	0	2	Can the authors address this point: is this database publicly available?
					0	Response to comment:
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	In the revised manuscript, this information was added.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	“This database is available to outside researchers after obtaining approval from the CDC and KP.
Author	Reviewer_1	2	5	5	1	Information regarding access to this database is at: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vsd/accessing-data.html.”

Author	Reviewer_2	2	6	1	1	Thank you.
					0	I highly recommend this manuscript for publication with minor revisions.
					0	This is a straightforward analysis of an important database with profound implications for public health.
					0	The Odds ratios presented are dose dependent and, above 37.5 uG of Hg, they reach over 4.5 which are tremendous associations between an exposure and a disease outcome.
					0	These results are relevant and important as thimerosal is still included in global vaccines although they have largely been removed from childhood vaccine in the United States.
					0	The writing is clear, the analysis is sound, and the presentation is excellent with a few exceptions.
